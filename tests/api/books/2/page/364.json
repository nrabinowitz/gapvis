{"text":" 566 NOTESON THE Section LXXXVIII. (a) See the Geographical Table at the end of the Eighth Volume. Section LXXXIX. (a) Furius Camillus Scribonianus commanded in Dalmatia, A.U. C. 795. Being a man of enterprise and bold ambition, he induced the soldiers to swear fidelity to himself, and went into open rebellion. His letters to the emperor Claudius were written in a tone of menace, requiring him to abdicate, and live a pri- vate citizen. In the mean time, the rebel legions, with the versatility common to the military mind, re- turned to their duty; Scribonianus fled to a small island of the Adriatic, on the coast of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"481865\" >Illyricum<\/span>, and there was. seized and put to death by Volaginius, a common soldier, on the fifth day of his revolt. Suetonius, in Claudio, s. 35. See Tacitus, Hist. ii. s. 75. ( ) Numa, the founder of religious ceremonies, made the Romans believe, that as long as they preserved the celestial arms, called Ancilia, which, he said, were sent down by the gods, <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"423025\" >Rome<\/span> would prove invincible, and triumph over all her enemies. Accordingly we read in Livy the procession of the Salian priests, on stated days, attending the Ancilia with song and dance through the streets of Rome. Salios ccelestia arma, quae Ancilia appellantur,ferre) ac per urlem irecanentet carmina cum tripudiis solemnique saltatu jusserat Numa. Livy, lib. i. s. 20. This institution was neglected by Otho.
