In the fame winter, Leon and Diomedon, being ar- rived at their post, at the head of the Athenian fleet, made an expedition against <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"590030\" >Rhodes<\/span>; and there they find the ships of the Peloponnesians hauled ashore. They made a descent upon the coast; and, after defeating in battle such of the Rhodians as made head against them, they stood away for Chalce, and for the future carried on the war more from thence than from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599728\" >Cos<\/span>; for in that station they were better enabled to watch the mo- tions of the Peloponnesian fleet., But at Rhodes arrived Xenophantidas, a Laced - monian, dispatched by P  daritus from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550496\" >Chios<\/span>, with ad- vice, that*' the works of the Athenians were almost\"perfected; and, unless with the whole of their Ihip-\"ping, they come over to relieve them, all is lost at'* Chios.\" A resolution accordingly was taken to en- deavour their relief; but, in the mean time, P  daritus, at the head of his body of auxiliaries and the Chians, with all the force he could assemble together, sallied out against the rampart which the Athenians had raised a- rouod their ships, demolished a part of it, and made himself master of those vessels which were hauled a- shore. The Athenians ran from all quarters to their defence; and, having first engaged and put to flight the Chians, the rest of the forces under P  daritus are also defeated. P  daritus is killed, as were numbers al- so of the Chians, and many arms were taken. And, after this, the Chians were blocked up by sea and land more closely than ever, and a terrible famine raged a- mongst them. The Athenian deputation, headed by Pisander, ha- ving reached Tissaphernes, enter into conference about terms of accommodation.
