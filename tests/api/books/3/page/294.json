{"text":" 3o6 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VIIL and, for the rest, as many as exceeded that number, pay was to be furnished at the race of only three oboli a day. The fame winter, the Athenians now lying at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599925\" >Samos<\/span> had been reinforced by the arrival of five and thirty fail from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579885\" >Athens<\/span>, under the command of Charminus, and Strombichides, and Euctemon j and they had farther assembled all their ships from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550496\" >Chios<\/span>, and others. A resolution was therefore taken, after assigning each his peculiar command by lot, to make up against it with at naval force, and awe <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599799\" >Miletus<\/span> j but to send against <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550496\" >Chios<\/span> both a naval and a land force; and this accordingly they put in execution. For, in fact, Strombichides, and Onomacles, and Euctemon, with a squadron of thirty sail and a body of transports, which had on- board a detachment from the thousand heavy-armed which came against <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599799\" >Miletus<\/span>, stood away for <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550496\" >Chios<\/span>, as this service had fallen to them by lot; but the rest of the commanders who now remained at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599925\" >Samos<\/span>, having un- der them seventy-four ships, were quite lords of the sea, and sailed boldly up to awe <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599799\" >Miletus<\/span>. Astyochus, who happened at this juncture to be in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550496\" >Chios<\/span>, selecting hostages as a prevention against treache- ry, thought proper for the present to desist, when he heard of the arrival of the squadron under Theramenes, and that their engagements with ThTaphernes were above three Mi a day. And hence it seems pretty clear, that the complement rf a Fcloponnesian skip of war was two hundred men.; I hare another proof ac hand, which will confirm what bath already.been said, and seive at the same time to ascertain the number of men on-board a ship of war. In the sixth book Thucydidet fays, the Egesleans brought to Athens sixty talents, as a month's pay for sixty (hips. He fays also, that in the Sicilian expedition the daily pay-ps the Athenian seamen was raised to a drachma a man. Now a talent a month, reckoning thirty days to the month, is two mime a day; and two mirnt are just two- hundred drachmas. Hence, it is plain, the complement of an Athenian thip was two hundred men; and, according to the former computation, that of a Peloponnefiast ihip was, as might reasonably be expected, exactly the fame. This is a farther con- firmation that there is a mistake in the printed copies of the original, as was (aid abort; where, instead of three talents, which amount but to 581\/. 51.sttrssttg, daould have been read thirty talents, amounting in Englisli money to 5812\/, 101. much","image":false}
