{"text":" B.VTIt. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 305 This being done, they again repaired to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599799\" >Miletus<\/span>; and from hence they detach P  daritus, the son of Leon, whom the'Laced  monians had sent expressly to be go- vernor of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550496\" >Chios<\/span>, to march over land to Erythr , ha- ving under his command the auxiliaries who had served under Amorges; and appoint Philippus to command at Miietus. And the summer ended. The winter now succeeding, after Tissaphernes had garrisoned and provided for the security of Iasus, he re- paired to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599799\" >Miletus<\/span>, and distributed a month's subsistence, in pursuance of his engagements at Laced  mon, to all the ships, at the rate of an* Attic drachma to each ma- riner by the day; but for the remainder of time he de- clared he would only pay at the rate of Jdiree oboli, till he had consulted the king's pleasure; and, in cs\"; his master's orders were for it, he said, he would make it up a complete drachma. But, as Hermocrates, the Sy- racusan commander, remonstrated sharply against this usage, (for Theramenes, not regarding himlelf as ad- miral, since he was now at the head of the fleet merely to carry it up to Astyochus, was very indolent about the article of pay,) it was at length compromised, that ex- cepting the five supernumerary ships, the crews of the reft should receive more than three oboli a man: For to the five and fifty ships he paid-f thiee talents a month; Vol. II.X and,* 7<l-!.J Half a drachma.   f- Thrre is manifestly a fault here; for Tfia, three, in the original, should be read.j-gtaxorV, thirty, talents a month. Mr. Hobbes hath taken the pains to compute, and finds that the Peloponnesian ships carried eighteen men apitce. What i only so imall a crew as eighteen men for a ship of war with three banks of oars? or, where (he complement was perhaps two hundred, did Tissaphernes only pay a tenth part of that number? Xenophon, in the first book of his Greek history, enables us to set all to light;, Lyfander is negotiating with Cyrus for an increase of pay. Cyrus insists upon Che former agreement, made by Tissaphernes, that every ship should receive but*h:rty m'wa a month. The daily pay of each was of course one mha, or one hun- dred drachmas: Whence it appears, that, at chree oboli, or half a drachma, a man, the pay of sixty ships, each carrving two hundred men, would be just thirty talents. Thirty talents, therefore, paid to silty-five shifS for a month, wat two talents and a half thirst","image":false}
