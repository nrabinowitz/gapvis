{"text":" B.VI. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 141  soldiers, without giving any alarm, pulled down a little gate of a very sorry structure, and then, entering the city, walked up and down in the market. But, such of the Cataneans as were of the Syracusan party no sooner found that the army was got in, than, struck into a sudden consternation, they stole presently out of the city. The number of these was but trifling. The rest of the inhabitants decreed an alliance with the Athenians, and encouraged them to fetch over the remainder of their armament from Rhegium. This point being carried, the Athenians, having pas- sed to Rhegium, were soon with the whole of their fleet under sail for Catana, and, on their arrival there, they formed a proper station for their ships and men. But now intelligence was brought them from Cama- rina that\" if they would come to countenance them,\"that city would declare on their sidei\" and that\"the Syracusans are busy in manning their fleet.\" With the whole armament therefore they steered along the coast, touching first at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"462503\" >Syracuse<\/span>. And, when they found that no fleet was there in readiness to put to sea, they stood off again for <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"462126\" >Camarina<\/span>; and there, approach- ing the shore, they notified their arrival by the voice of a herald.

On their return thither they find the Salaminian ar- rived from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579885\" >Athens<\/span> to fetch back Alcibiades, by pub- lic order of the State, to take his trial for the crimes charged against him by his country, and also soms Gihtfs","image":false}
