{"text":"  i8 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VIL the horsemen, mounted guard by night. The latter, e-'ver under arms without, the rest on the constant guard of the city-walls, and this for a summer and winter without any intermission, were reduced to a very low condition. But the point which pressed hardest upon them was having two wars at once upon their hands; and yet their obstinacy had rose to so high a pitch, as, had it not been visible to all the world, the bare men- tion of its possibility would hare been quite incredible: For who would have believed, that this people, fo closely blocked up at home by the Peloponnesians, should scorn to give up Sicily? nay, should persevere with unabating zeal, to carry on the siege of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"462503\" >Syracuse<\/span>, a city in no respect inserior even to Athens itself? that they should exhibit such an astonishing proof of their strength and their courage to the eyes of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1001896\" >Greece<\/span>; where, upon the first breaking out of the war, some people had imagined, that, in case the Peloponnefians invaded Atti- ca, they could not hold out above one year intire, though others had allowed them two, and others three, but nobody a longer space? and that, in the seventeenth year after the first invasion of this kind, they should at- tempt the conquest of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"981549\" >Sicily<\/span>; and, when deeply gashed in every parr, by one war already upon their hands, should wilfully plunge into another, as formidable in all respects as that waged against them from Peloponne- sus?
