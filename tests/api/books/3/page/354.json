Yet, not in this instance only, but many others, the Laced  monians shewed them- selves most commodious enemies for the Athenians to encounter: For, as nothing differed more than their respective tempers; the one being active, the other stow; enterprising these, but timorous those, especially in na- val competitions; they gave them many advantages. The truth of this the Syracusans most plainly (hewed, who very nearly resembled the Athenians in disposition, and so warred against them with the highest spirit and success. Terrified, however, at these tidings, the Athenians made a shift to man out twenty vessels, and convened an assembly of the people, on the first report of their loss, in the place which is called the Pnyx, and where generally that assembly was held. In this they put an end to the administration of the sour-hundred, and de- creed\" the supreme power to be vested in the Jive-\"thousand, which number to confist of all such citi- zens as were enrolled for the heavy armour; and*' that no one should receive a salary for any public ma-** gistracy; whoever offended in this point they de-\"dared a traitor.\" Other frequent assemblies were afterwards held, in which they appointed Nomatheta* and filled up the other posts in the government. And now at least, though for the first time in my opinion, the Athenians seem to have modelled their government* The general course of appointing Nomatbtta was by lot. Their number in the whole was a thousand and one. Their business was not, as the nane seems to im- ply, to make new laws, since that belonged to the lupreme power lodged in the peo- ple; but to. inspect such as were already made, to re-considcr such as were thought to be, or were complained of as, grievous, aud tegularly report fab as ought to be continued or ought to be repealed. aright.","image":false}
