{"text":" 12 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.V. to shew their high respect fdr the Laced  monian a!li-'ance, as they stood in great dread of the Athenians. For, considering their hostile embroilments with the Athenians, they thought it neither for their interest nor satisfaction to continue the honours of Agnon. To the Athenians they also delivered the bodies of their dead. The number of them, on the Athenian side, amounted to six hundred, whereas the enemy lost but seven men. This was owing to the nature of the fight, which had not been carried on in a regularvman- ner, but was rather a Daughter, in consequence of a surprise and sudden consternation. After the reception of cheir dead, the Athenians sailed away for <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579885\" >Athens<\/span>; but those under the orders of Clearidas applied them- selves to re-settle and secure <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"501347\" >Amphipolis<\/span>. About the same time, in the close of this summer, Ramphias, and Autocharidas, and Epicydidas, Lace- d  monians, were conducting up, for the Thracian ser- vice, a reinforcement consisting of nine hundred heavy- armed. Being arrived at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"648614\" >Heraclea<\/span>, in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"541157\" >Trachis<\/span>, they regulated there such things as seemed to require an a- mendment; and, during the season they halted here, the battle of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"501347\" >Amphipolis<\/span> was fought, and the summer ended. But, early as possible in the succeeding winter, the reinforcement under Ramphias proceeded on their route as far as Pierium of Thessaly. But, the Thessalians op- posing their farther passage, and Brasidas being now dead, to whom they were conducting this supply, they returned home. They imagined that their aid was no longer wanting, as the Athenians, in consequence of their overthrow, had quitted that country, and them- selves had not sufficient ability to carry the plans into execution which Brasidas had been meditating. But the principal motive of their return was their own conscious- ness, at setting out, that the Laced  monians were more inclined to peace.","image":false}
