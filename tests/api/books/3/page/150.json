Having also had intelligence, that the Athenians had sent an embassy to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"462126\" >Camarina<\/span>, under favour of a treaty made formerly with them by Laches, to try if it were possible to procure their concurrence; they also dis- patched an embassy thither, to traverse the negotiation. For, the Camarineans were suspected by them, as if they had not cordially sent in their quota of assistance for the first battle, and lest for the future they might be totally averse from acting in their support, as in that battle they had seen the Athenians victorious, and so, induced by the former treaty they had made with the latter, might now declare openly on their side.

And to me it is clear, that their schemes,*' have no tendency to replant the Leontines, but ra-*' ther to supplant us all. For, how is it reconcileable'* with common-fense, that a people, who have ever\"been employed in the ruin of the States which are*' neighbouring to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579885\" >Athens<\/span>, should be sit.cere in re-'* establishing","image":false}
