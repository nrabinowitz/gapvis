{"text":" 2+ THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR: B.V. ance. And at length, necessitated to dissolve the treaty concluded at the ten years period, they engaged afresh in open war. The same Thucydides, an Athenian, hath also compiled an account of these latter transactions in a re- gular series, according to the summers and winters, down to that period of time when the Laced  monians and their allies put an end to the empire of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579885\" >Athens<\/span>, and became masters of the Icng-walls and the Pir  us. The whole continuance of the war to this period was twenty* seven years. And, if any man be inclined to think that this intervening accommodation mould not be reckoned as war, he will find no arguments to support his opini- on: For, let him only survey the transactions as they are distinctly related, and he will find it an absurdity to pro? nounce that an interval of peace, in which neither all the restitutions were made, nor the benesits obtained, which the mutual stipulations required. And, setting these considerations aside, in the Mantinean and Epidau- ric and other wars, transgressions were committed on both sides. The confederates also of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"501638\" >Thrace<\/span> continued still to be as great enemies as ever. And the B  otians never agreed to more than a bare cessation of arms, re* newable every tenth day. Including, therefore, the first war, which lasted ten years, and that suspicious interval which ensued, and ended at last in a second open rupture, the whole conti- nuance, if computed by summers and winters, will turn out, upon enquiry, to have been so many years, and some few additional days. And such as laid stress up* on the predictions of oracles can assent only to this com- putation as genuine. For my own part, I perfectly well remember that, not only at the commencement, but even during the whole course, of the war, many such predictions were gi^:n out, that\" it must needs\"continue three times nine years.\" I also lived through. jts whole extent, jn the very flower of my understand- ing and strength, and with a close application of my thoughts","image":false}
