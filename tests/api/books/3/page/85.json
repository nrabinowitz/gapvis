{"text":" B.VI. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 97 war with the latter, about some connubial points, and a certain tract of land to which both laid claim. The Selinuntians, farther4 assisted by their Syracuf'an allies, pressed hard upon them both by land and sea. And hence, the Egesteans were now suggesting at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579885\" >Athens<\/span>, that*' they ought not to forget their alliance with the*' Leonttnes, made by Laches in the former warre* questing farther, that a naval force might be sent thither for their succour. To this purpose many other argu- ments were alledged by them, but the principal was this:\"If the Syracusans, who have overthrown the Leon-*' tines, be left in the unmolested enjoyment of their\"conquest, and proceed still farther to destroy the re-\"maining parties of that alliance, they will get into*' their hands the whole power of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"981549\" >Sicily<\/span>. Such an e-\"vent would be attended with the utmost danger; lest*' in consequence of it, as they were Doric by descent,\"they might think, themselves bound by the ties\"of blood to assist with a powerful armament their kin-*' dred Dorians, and, in quality of colonies, might suc-\"cour those Peloponnesians by whom they were origi-** nally planted, and thus form a combination to de-\"molish the Athenian empire. In policy, therefore,\"the Athenians were obliged to support the allies who\"yet remained, in order to make head against the Sy-\"racusans; and this the more readily, as they them-\"selves would undertake to furnissi them with sums\"of money equal to the exigencies of the war.\" With such discourle the Athenians were frequently entertained in their popular assemblies, as the Egestean embassa- dors, still urging their point, had gained many advo- cates to second their arguments. And at length it was decreed, that\"embassadors should be previously dis-*' patched to Egesta to inspect the state of their wealth,\"whether they had such sums as they talked of in the\"public treasury and the temples; and also to draw** up a report of the present posture of their war against Vol. II.H\"the ","image":false}
