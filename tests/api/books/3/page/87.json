{"text":" JB.VIi THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR.;, YEAR XVII.J IN the succeeding summer, very early in the spring, the Athenian embassadors returned from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"991353\" >Sicily<\/span>, accompa- nied by the Egesteans. They brought sixty talents of uncoined silver, being a month's pay for sixty fail of ships, the equipment of which for succour they were instructed to solicit from the Athenians. Upon this, an assembly of the people was called, and the reports ef the Egistean and their own embassadors were recei- ved, consisting of many points, specious indeed, but false in fact; and, so far as related to their treasure, that** sums ample enough are already reposited in their** temples and their public treasury.\" In consequence of this, a decree was made, that\" a fleet of sixty ships\"should sail for Sicily; the commanders, Alcibiades,\"the son of Clinias, Nicias, the son ot Niceratus, and i^amachus, the son of Xenophanes, to be invested*: with full powers to act at their own discretion.

He was now (according to Plutarch] a brave old experien- ced officer. In his youth he had been rtm.rkable for heat and fire; a length of ser- vice and years had mellowed him into the right temper, to deliberate beforehand, and then gallantly to carry the point into execution. But then, he wanted the means of properly supporting the authority and dignity of His post. He was now ranked with two of the most wealthy and noble Athenians; whereas his own condition was low; nay, he was (according to Plutarch) so exceedingly poor, that, berore he went to any foreign command, he was used to petition the Slate for a little money to fur- nifli him out, and even to buy him some (hoes.

Aristophanes hath represent- ed Lamachus as a vain-glorious roaring bully, a mere thing of arms, a creature of ver- bal p^mp and parade; contrary to all the truth of history. Writers, who live by turnirtg great ard good men into ridicule, should never be reckoned good evidence as to the truth and reality of characters, when history dissents.H 2\"whole","image":false}
