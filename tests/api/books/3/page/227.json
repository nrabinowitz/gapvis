As to the proposal of continuing the siege, Demos- thenes would not yield the least degree of attention to it:\" if ithe army must not evacuate Sicily without a*.* peremptory order from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579885\" >Athens<\/span>, but must persist in\"this destructive service, he judged it would be better\"to draw them off to Thapsus or to Catana, whereM they might find opportunity enough to make incur-** sions with the land-army upon the territories of the\"enemy, and, by committing devastations, migbc\"highly distress them. Their fleet might then en-*' gage'n tne open sea; not in a space confined and\"straitened, which was the greatest advantage to the\"enemy, but in sufficient sea-room, where all their'su-*1 perior skill might fairly be exerted, where they\"would be able to make their tacks, and bear down a-*' gain upon the foe with greater agility, and more vio-\"lent (hocks, than could be done in the limitary space** of a close pent-up harbour. Upon the whole, he af-** firmed, that his consent should never be given to a\"longer continuance in their present posts, but he was\"for moving off with all possible expedition, and they*' had not a moment to lavish upon delay.\" ( Eurymedon","image":false}
