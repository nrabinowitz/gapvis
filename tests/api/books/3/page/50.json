{"text":" 62 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR: 6.V, withdrawn, and quite out of their view, after lying in- actively in their posts, and no orders received sor a pursuit, they began a second time to lay heavy imputa- tions on their own commanders;   that,\"on the for-\"mer occasion, the Laced  monians, when fairly** caught near <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570106\" >Argos<\/span>, had been susfered to escape y** that now again, though they were openly flying, not\"a soul must pursue them, but, through shameful in-** dolence, their enemies are preserved, and themselves** are treacherously betrayed.\" The commanders, up- on the first noise of these clamours, were highly chagri- ned, but afterwards they marched them down srom the eminence, and, advancing into the plain, encamped them there, as determined to fight the enemy. The day following, the Argives and allies were drawn up to be in readiness for action, should the enemy appear. And the Laced  monians, marching away from the stream, to re-occupy their former camp near the tem- ple of Hercules, on a sudden perceived that the whole body of their foes were ready drawn up in order of bat- tle, and had quitted their strong post on the eminence. At this crisis, the Laced  monians were struck with a grearer astonishment than the memory of man could parallel. For now, in an interval os time excee- ding short, they were bound to get every thing in rea- diness for fight: Yet, such was their diligence, that in an instant they were formed into a beautiful array, A- gis, their kingjissuing all the necessary orders, according to law; for, when a king leadeth their armies, all orders are given by him: He himself declareth what he willeth to be done to the* general-officers; they carry his orders to the-f colonels; these to theJ captains; who after- wards forward them to the  subalterns; by whom they are communicated to all the private men under their re-* Poltroarch .   \\ Lochages,J Pentecontators,  Enomatarchj. spective","image":false}
