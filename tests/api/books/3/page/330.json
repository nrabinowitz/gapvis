{"text":" 3+1 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VIIL low, and banished by the ostracism, not from a dread of his influence or weight, but for the profligacy of his life and his being a public disgrace to his country. In this they were countenanced by Charminus, one of the commanders, and some of the Athenians afibciated with them, to whom they gave this pledge of their sidelity. Some other acts of the fame nature they committed by instructions from them, and had it in agitation to multi- ply their blows>, but those marked out for destruction, getting wind of their design, communicate the whole to Leon and Diomedon, who thought of an oligarchy with high regret, because their credit was high with the peo- ple; to*Thrasybulus also andThrasyllus, the.former* captain of a trireme, and the latter of a band of heavy- armed; and to such others as were judged most likely to stem the fury of the conspirators. These they con-\"such exalted characters. It was dear honour to Hyperbolus; and gave him\"room to boast, that, though a scoundrel, he had been distinguistied like the greats*\"and best Athenians; as Plato, the comic poet, fays of him,\"He always acted worthy of himself,\"But quite unworthy of luch high reproof:'\"The jhtll was ne'er design'd to honour scoundrels.\"In a word, no person was ever banished by the ostracism after Hyperbolus j it\"was he who closed the list.\"* Thrasybulus, whose name now first occurs, acts a very high-spirited and noble yart in the close of this history.\"If virtue could be weighed merely by itself,\"without any regard to outward circumstance, I should not hesitate (fays Cor-\"nelius Nepos) to prefer him before all the great men in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1001896\" >Greece<\/span>. But I aver,\"that not one of them ever surpassed him in integrity, in resolution, in grandeur\"of soul, and true patriotism.   Yet, 1 know not how it it, though nobody\"excelled him in real merit, many have outstripped him in point of fame. In\"the Peloponnesian war, (ibi tpart if it vibicb n<m rtmaim,) Thrasybulus did many things without Aleibiades; Aleibiades did nothing without Thrasybulus;\"and yet the other, through a happiness peculiar to himself, reaped the glory and\"benefit os all.\" So far this elegant Roman writer. The reader will soon see some of Thrasybulus his exploits, separately fronvsnd in concert with Akibiades: But the iglory of his lite was ridding <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579885\" >Athens<\/span> some year's after of thirty tyrants at a blow; fer which he was rewarded by a wreath of olive, the most honourable recompence his grateful countrymen could bestow upon him. He-was ever a firm, intrepid, disin- terested, patriot j an d lost his life at last in the service of his country.","image":false}
