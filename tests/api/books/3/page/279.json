Aad immediate- ly the  they had determined to dispatch away the com- mander Chalcideus, accompanied by Alcibiades, with the five ships of their own equipment; but, at the in- stant they were ready to move off\", the news arrived,   that\" the squadron had been drove into Pir  us.\" De- jected by this unexpected event, because they had stum- bled in the very first entrance on an Ionian war, they no longer persisted in the design of sending away their owa Ihips, but even thought of recalling some of those which were already at sea. But, as this was discovered hy Alcibiades, he again persuades Endius, and the o- ther Effort, by no means intirely to give up the expedi- tion i alluring them, that\" by a timely dispatch they** yet might make that island, before any information\"of the disaster which had befallen the squadron** could reach the Chians; and of himself, were he** once in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550597\" >Ionia<\/span>, he could easily effectuate the revolt\"of the cities, by opening their eyes in respect to the\"weakness of the Athenians and the hearty and vigo-** rous interposition of the Laced  monians, since on** these topics he should he heard with greater deference** than any other person whatever.\" He also privately encouraged Endius with the prospect of** great glory to** himself, if through him <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550597\" >Ionia<\/span> could be brought to i* revolt, and the king be made consederate to Laced  -\"mon, whilst Agis had no hand in these masterly\"strokes of policy,\" for he happened now to be ac* variance with Agis.
