B.VIII. at Harmatus, which lies facing Methymne, and having cat their dinner there, they passed with the utmost speed by Lectus, and Larissa, and Amaxitus, and other ad- jacent places, and reach Rh  tium of the Hellespont before midnight. Not but that some ships of the fleet got up no farther than to Sig  um and some other adja- cent places on that coast.
