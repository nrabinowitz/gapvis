{"text":" 268 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B. VII.\"life. Upon the strength of this, when I look for-** wards to the future, my mind is enlivened with invi-\"gorating hope; though I own these misfortunes, so*' far undeserved, strike no little terror on my\"thoughts. But better times, perhaps, may be ap-*' proaching; for sure our enemies have been blessed<i with an ample measure of success; and, though some*' deity may have frowned at first on this our expedi-** tion, yet by this time his wrath must be fully wreaked\"upon us. We are not the first instance of a people** who have wantonly invaded the possessions of ano-\"ther; many such offences have taken their rife from\"the impulse of human passions, and have been pu-*' nished with such a measure of vengeance as human\"nature was able to endure. Good reason, therefore,*' have we now to hope for a milder fate from the of-\"fended deity, who, depressed as we are, seem objects\"of compassion more than of resentment. Cast, there-*' fore, your eyes on the fine bodies of heavy-armed,\"and the goodly numbers, which even now compose*' your retreat; and let the sight revive and cheer your\"drooping spirits. Conclude that, wherever you choose\"to halt,you areof yourselves that instant a mighty com-*' munity; such as no other Sicilian people can presume*, to stand before, should you attack; hor to dispossess,\"wherever you think proper to settle. But, that your*' march be orderly and safe, be that the care of each\"individual amongst your ranks, made warm and ear-*' nest by the thought,   that, on whatever spot you\"may be compelled to fight, on that, if crowned with\"victory, you regain a country and a bulwark of your\"own. But then, our march must be continued both day*' and night, with unabating speed, because our stock\"of provision is but scanty; and, can we but reach\"some friendly territory belonging to the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"197511\" >Siculi<\/span>, who,\"from their excessive diead of the Syracusans, will ever\"preserve their attachment to us, conclude yourselves\"that moment to be beyond the reach of danger:.:\"'\"Send,","image":false}
