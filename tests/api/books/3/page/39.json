{"text":"&V. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. sr YEAR XIII.J THE succeeding summer was no sooner begun, than the B  otians, viewing the low estate to which it had been reduced by the late battle, took into their own hands the city of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"648614\" >Heraclea<\/span>, and discharged Hegesippi- das, the Laced  monian commandant, as guilty of mal- administration. They took this city into their own hands, from the apprehension that, during the em- broilments of the Laced  monians in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570577\" >Peloponnesus<\/span>, the Athenians might seize it. The Laced  monians, howe- ver, were chagrined at this step of the B  otians. This fame summer also, Alcibiades, the son of Cli- nias, being general of the Athenians, with the concur- rence of the Argives and their allies, entered Pelopon- nesus with a small party of heavy-armed Athenians and archers, and enlarged his forces upon his route by the aids of the confederates in those quarters j where he not only made such a disposition of asfairs as might best an- swer the views of the alliarrce, but also, traversing Pe- loponnesus with his force, he both persuaded the Pa- treans to continue their works quite down to the sea and intended also to execute a plan of his own for erec- ting a fort upon the Rhium of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"981502\" >Achaia<\/span>.-f But the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"138251\" >Co<\/span>- rinthians, and Sicyonians, and all such as were alarmed at the annoyance this fort might give them, rushed out to prevent him, and obliged him to desist. The same summer a war broke out between the Epi- daurians and the Argives. The pretext was grounded on a victim due from the Epidaurians to the'Pythian Apollo, as an acknowledgement for their pastures; forJ Before Christ 419.   f This was a graed project indeed! It aimed at no less than the total ruin of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"138251\" >Co<\/span>- rinth, and putting an end to all the navigation of that trading and opulent city through the hay of Crisla, The Athenians were already intire masters of the sea on the other side of the isthmus.E 2 the","image":false}
