{"text":" B.V. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. n though Cleon, who from the sirst had never intended to. stand an engagement, flies instantly awayand, being intercepted by a Myrcinian targeteer, is slain. But his heavy-armed, embodying together and gaining an emi- nence, repulsed Clearidas, who twice or thrice attacked them, and maintained their ground till the Myrcinian and Chalcidic cavalry and the targeteers,'surrounding and pouring in their darts upon them, compelled them to fly. Thus the whole Athenian army was distressed in a laborious flight: They ran different ways amongst the mountains; numbers had been destroyed in the charge, others by the Chalcidic horse and targeteers; but the remainder escaped in safety to Ei'on. Those who took up Brasidas, when he dropped in the action, and bore him osf, carried him into the city yet alive. His senses remained till he heard his party were victorious, and soon after that he expired.* The rest of the army with Clearidas, being come back from the pursuit, rifled the dead and erected a trophy. This done, all the confederates assisted under arms at the funeral of Brafidas, whom they interred at the pub- lic expence within the city, near the place where the fo- rum now standeth. And afterwards the Amphipolitans, having inclosed his monument, performed sacrisice to him as a hero. They also enacted solemn games in his honour and annual sacrifices. Nay, they ascribed their colony to him as founder, after demolishing the edisices of Agnon, and defacing every memorial which might continue the memory of his foundation. They acted thus, partly out of real gratitude to Brafidas, whom they regarded as their deliverer, and partly at this juncture* The first embassy, which came from the Grecians in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"501638\" >Thrace<\/span> to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570406\" >Sparta<\/span>, after the death of Brafidas, made a visit to his mother Argileonis. The first queston she asked them was, Didmy fin die bravely? And when the embassadors expatiated largely in his praise, and said, at last. There was not such another Spartan left alive,   * You mistake, gentlemen, said the mother, my fin was a good man j but there are many teller men than be in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570406\" >Sparta<\/span>, Plutarch's Laconic Apophthegms. to","image":false}
