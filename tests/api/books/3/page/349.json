{"text":" B.VIII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 361 patrole assigned for Munichia; and, what was of most importance, it was openly countenanced by the whole body of the heavy-armed. The news of it was imme- diately carried to the four hundred, who were this mo- ment assembled together in council; and all, except- ing those dissatisfied with their measures, were ready to run to arms, and vented terrible threats against <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599973\" >Thera<\/span>- menes and his associates. But he, apologizing for himself, declared his readi- ness to take up arms along with them, and attend them to the rescue of Alexicles; and, taking with him one of the generals who was in his secret, he hurried down to the Pir  us. Aristarchus also ran down to assist; as did, farther, the young men belonging to the cavalry of the State. Great, in truth, was the tumult, and full of horror: For those who were left in the upper-city imagined that the Pir  us was already seized, and that Alexicles was\/lain; and they in the Pir  us each moment expected an assault from those in the city. Not without difficulty could the men of years and experience stop such as were wildly running up and down the streets, and rushing to arms. And Thucydides, the Pharsalian, public host of the State, who happened then to be at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579885\" >Athens<\/span>, threw himself with lively zeal in the way ot all who were flock- ing down; conjuring them earnestly\" not to finish f' the ruin of their country, when the enemy lay so\"near to strike the blow.\" But thus, at length, their fury abated, and the effusion of one another's blood was prevented. As for Theramenes, he was no sooner got down to the Pir  us, than, assuming authority, (for he himself was at this time a general,) he pretended to rate the heavy-armed for this piece of mutiny, at least so far as mere making a noise could do it; whilst Aristarchus and all the opposite faction were angry with them in earnest. But the bulk of the heavy-armed drew together in a body, and betray no sign of regret for what they had done.","image":false}
