{"text":"|68 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B. VI.\"OUR journey hither was intended for the renewal** of a former alliance; but, as this Syracusan hath ta-\"ken the liberty to be severe upon us, we lie under an\"obligation to flhew the justice of our title to that share** of dominion which we now possess. And the strong-\"tst evidence of this he himself hath been pleased to** give, by affirming, that lonians have been eternal foes to Dorians. The fact is incontestibly true:\"Since we, who are lonians, have been necessitated to\"stand ever upon our guard against the incroaching** designs of the Pcloponnesians, who are Dorians, who** are our superiors in number, and are seated upon our** borders. When, therefore, in the close of the Per- f* sian invasion, we saw ourselves masters of a navy, we** asserted our own independence from the government*f and guidance of the Laced  monians, since no sha-** dow of reason could be found why we should be obe-** dient to them any more than they to us, save only.\" that in this critical period their strength was greater,*^ We were afterwards appointed, by free election, the** leaders of those lonians who had sormerly been sub-\"ject to the monarch. And the preference awarded to us we continue to support; assured that on'y thus we f shall escape subjection to the Peloponnesian yoke, by** keeping possession of a power which can effectually\"awe all their incroachments. And, farther, (that we\"may come to particulars,) it was not with injustice** that we exacted subjection from those lonians, and in-\"habitants of the isles, whom the Syracusans fay we f* thought proper to inflave, though connected with us** by the ties ot blood: For they marched, in companyV with the Mcde, against their mother-country, against** us, their founders. They had not the courage to ex-** pose their own homes to ruin and devastation by an y honest revolt, though we with magnanimity aban-\"doned even <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579885\" >Athens<\/span> itself. They made slavery theirK choice, and in the same miserable fate would have** been.","image":false}
