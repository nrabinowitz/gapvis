{"text":" B.VIir. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 3rr*' in cafe an accommodation be taken in hand, be it*' settled by both parties acting in conjunction.\"But, whatever army be brought info the territo-** ries of the king at the request, and summons of the\"king, the king to defray the expence.*' And, if any of the States, comprehended in this\"league with the king, invade the territories of the\"king, the others to oppose and act with all their power** in defence of the king.\"And, if any province belonging to the king, or\"subject to his dominion, invade the territory of the\"Laced  monians or confederates; the king to oppose,** and with all his power to defend the party invaded.\" When the finishing-hand was put to this treaty, Theramenes, after delivering up the fleet to Astyo- chus, puts to sea in a fly-boat, and entirely disappears.- But the Athenians from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550763\" >Lesbos<\/span>, having now made their passage and landed their forces in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550496\" >Chios<\/span>, and be- ing masters of the coast and sea, fortified Delphinium; a place remarkably strong by nature towards the land, abounding, farther, with harbours, and seated at no considerable distance from the city of the Chians. And, now the Chians, dispirited by the many defeats they had already received, and, what is worse, far from be- ing actuated by general unanimity, (bur, on the con- trary, Tydeus the Ionian and his adherents having been lately put to death by P  daritus for atticizing, and the rest of the citizens obliged by necessity to sub- mit to the few, each individual amongst them suspect- ing his neighbour,)   the Chians now remained quite inactive. Thus, for the reasons above-mentioned, they neither looked upon themselves, nor the auxiliaries un- der P  daritus, as a match for the enemy. Yet, as theit last resource, they send to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599799\" >Miletus<\/span>, requesting As- tyochus to come over to their succour. But, as he was deaf to their intreaties, P  daritus fends a letter to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570417\" >La<\/span>- ced  mon about him, which accused him of injustice.X 4 And","image":false}
