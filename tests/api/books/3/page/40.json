{"text":" 52 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.V, the Argives were now the chief managers of the tem- ple. But, this pretended grievance let apart, it had been judged expedient, by Alcibiades and the Argives, to get possession, if possible, of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570228\" >Epidaurus<\/span>, in order to prevent molestation on the side of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570182\" >Corinth<\/span>, and to ren- der the passage of Athenian succours more expeditious from  gina than by setching a compass about Scyll  - um. The Argives, therefore, were intent on their pre- parations, as resolved to take the field and act against Epidaurus, in order to exact the victim by force of arms. Bur, about the fame time, the Laced  monians also marched out, with their whole force, as sar as to Leuc- tra, upon their own frontier, towards Lyceum, under the command of Agis, the son of Archidamus, their king. Not a man was privy to the design of their thus taking the field, not even the States from which the quotas were furnished out. But, when the victims they sacrificed for a successful campaign proved inauspi- cious, they again marched home, and circulated fresh orders to their consederates to be ready to take the field again after the next month, which was the month Car- ndus,-f- the grand festival of the Dorians. But, when they were thus withdrawn, the Argives, taking the field on the twenty-seventh day of the month preceding Carneius, and though celebrating their own festival thac very day, continued all this intermediate time to make incursions and ravages upon Epidauria. The Epidau- rians sent about to solicit the succours of their allies j fome of whom excused themselves as bound to observe the approaching sestivals, though others advanced as   f This festival was observed by most cities in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1001896\" >Greece<\/span>; but with the greatest pomp and solemnity at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570406\" >Sparta<\/span>, where it began the thirteenth of the month Carneius-, according to the Laced  monian stile, and lasted nine days. A camp was formed for its celebration, in wlich they continued during the whole solemnity, and observed fliict military discipline. By these means, as we find a little lower, the Argives, i n this instance no slaves to superstition, attended to the festival and warfare at the same time, and anrojcd the Epidaurians, whilst religions awe restrained the friends of th* latter siotii acting in their deser.ee.
