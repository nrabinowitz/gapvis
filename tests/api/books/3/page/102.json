It will not be now your employment to march** to the relief of your dependents seated near to A-\"thens against a hostile invasion, where all the needsul supplies would be brought to your camp out of the** territories of friends; but you are to roam to a dif-** tant climate, where you cannot call one inch of ground** your own, and from whence, in the four winter months,** vou will scarcely be able to send a messenger to A-\"thens.\"In my opinion, therefore, it is incumbent upon us** to carry thither large parties of heavy-armed, to be\"raised out of our own citizens, our allies, and our\"dependents, and an additional strength of Pelopon-** nesians, if we are able to procure it by persuasion or** by pay.
