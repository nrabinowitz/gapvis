{"text":" 58 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.V, On the other part also, the Argives were still much, more exasperated against those, who had made this sus- pension without public authority. They imagined the Laced  monians had escaped them, when they had the finest opportunity of striking a blow, inasmuch as the contest must have been decided under the very walls of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570106\" >Argos<\/span>, and in company with a numerous and gallant alliance. And hence, upon their return, at the Chara* drum, the place where the crimes committed in an ex- pedition are adjudged, before they enter the city, they were beginning to stone Thrasyllus, who, flying to an altar, escapeth with life: His effects, however, thty confiscated to public use. But, after this, came up the Athenian succour, con- sisting of a thousand heavy-armed and three hundred horsemen, commanded by Laches and Nicostratus, The Argives, who, after all, were afraid to break the agreement with the Laced  monians, ordered them to*' be gone forthwith;\" and, though they requested a conference, refused to introduce them into the assembly of the people, till the Mantineans and Eleans, who were not yet departed, by great importunity obtained a com- pliance. Here the*Athenians, in the presence of Al- cibiades their embassador, assembled with the Argives and their allies, averred, that\" the suspension was not** valid, since agreed to without the consent of the bo-\"dy of the confederates; now, therefore, as themselves\"were come up opportunely to their assistance, they\"were obliged in honour to prosecute the war.\" The confederates allowed the force of this argument; and the whole alliance, except the Argives, marched instant- ly away against <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570535\" >Orchomenus<\/span>, of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570102\" >Arcadia<\/span>. But even the Argives, though they stayed behind at first, were persuaded by such reasoning, and soon after went also to take part in the expedition. Thus united, they sat down before and besieged <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570535\" >Orchomenus<\/span>. They made several assaults upon it, desirous for other reasons to get* Laches and Nicostratus. it","image":false}
