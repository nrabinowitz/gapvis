The Athenians, with three and thirty sail, under the command of Diphilus, weighed from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"540960\" >Naupactus<\/span>, and stood in against them. At first, the Corinthians lay still without motion; but, so soon as it was judged ne- cessary for them to act, and the signal-flag was accord- ingly hoisted, they advanced to charge the Athenians, and an engagement ensued.
