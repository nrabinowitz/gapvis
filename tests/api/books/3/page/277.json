{"text":" B.VIIT. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 289 Expeditious sailing was earnestly solicited; but the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"138251\" >Co<\/span>- rinthians declared a reluctancy to go the voyage till they had celebrated the Isthmian games, which were at hand. To remove this obstacle, Agis declared him- self ready to have the whole procedure charged to his own account, that they might be cleared from a breach of the Isthmian cessation. The Corinthians not com* plying with this proposal, and delay necessarily result- ing from it, the Athenians gained by this an earlier dis* covery of the negotiation of the Chians; and, dispatch- ing Aristocrates, one of their generals, charged them openly with the guilt of such a procedure.

The practices of the Chians became here more apparent to them than ever. No sooner, therefore, were they returned to A- thens, than they put all the needful expedients in rea- diness, to prevent the squadron, which was to fail from Cenchre , from passing undiscovered. When the festival was over, the latter, with one and twenty fail, under the command of Alcamenes, stood out to sea in order for <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550496\" >Chios<\/span>.
