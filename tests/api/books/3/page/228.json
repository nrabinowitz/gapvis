{"text":" 240 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR\/ B.VII.% Eurymedon then declared that his sense of things co- incided with that of Demosthenes; and, Nicias persist- ing in the contrary opinion, a sit of languor and sus- pence ensued, attended with the secret imagination that the pofitiveness of Nicias resulted from some stronger hopes of success he had conceived above his colleagues. And in this manner the Athenians fell into dilatory mea- sures, and continued in their camp before <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"462503\" >Syracuse<\/span>. But in this interval Gylippus and Sicanos returned to Syracuse: Sicanus, truly, disappointed of Agrigen- tum, for he was advanced no farther than <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"462215\" >Gela<\/span> when the sedition in favour of the Syracusans was brought to an amicable period; but then Gylippus was returned at the head of a numerous body, consisting of levies made in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"981549\" >Sicily<\/span>, and the heavy-armed troops from Peloponne- sus, who in the spring had put to sea on-board the transport, but came over last from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"324852\" >Africa<\/span> to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"462489\" >Selinus<\/span>; for into <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"324852\" >Africa<\/span> they had been driven by contrary winds j and, having there been furnished by the Cyreneans with two triremes and a set of pilots, as they coasted along the African shore, they relieved the Evesperit , then blocked up by the Libyans.

But the Athenian generals,   finding they had received so large an augmentation, and that the posture of their own affairs was so far from being changed for the better that day after day it grew worse in every re- spect, and, what was worst of all, that their troops were quite exhausted with fatigue and sickness,   they repent- ed now in earnest that they had not drawn off in time; and, as Nicias now no longer opposed that step with the same vehemence as he had done before, but merely en- deavoured","image":false}
