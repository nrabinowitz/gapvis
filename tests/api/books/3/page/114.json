{"text":" 126 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.Vf,\"which,' though perhaps, inured as you are to domestic indolence, ic may not gain your ready approbation, rt I (hall however boldly recommend. Would all of\"us in general who are inhabitants of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"991353\" >Sicily<\/span>, or at least** would only we Syracusans, with what other people\"we Can get to assist us, put out instantly to sea with** all the ships we have in readiness, and victualled** but for the space of two months;   would we then** giVe'these Athenians the meeting either at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"442810\" >Tarentum<\/span>** or cape Japygia, and there convince them, that, be-\"fore they enter the lists of war for the conquest of  Sicily, they must fight for their passage across the\"Ionian;   we should then strike them with the utmost** terror, and infinitely perplex them with the thought*** that from a friendly port we shall sally forth to guard** our out-works, (for <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"442810\" >Tarentum<\/span> will readily receive us,}** whilst they have a long tract of sea to pass with all** their cumbersome train, and must find it hard,** the regular order.' As their course must thus be slow,'\"and must advance only in exact conformity to orders,\"we shall have a thousand opportunities to attack them.** If again they clear their ships for action, and in a body bear down expeditiously upon us\"* they must** ply hard at their oars; and, when spent with their** toil,\"we'can fall upon them. Or, in case that may** not be judged adviseable, we have it always in our\"power to retire into the harbour of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"442810\" >Tarentum<\/span>. And** thus the Athenians, if, in constant expectation of be-\"ing fought with at sea they must make their passage** with a small portion only of their stores, will be re- duced to great distress on coasts, which will afford** them no supply. Should they choose to continue in** their station, they must infallibly be blockedupin.it.\"Should they venture a passage, they must unavoidably** leave their tenders and storeships behind; and, as** they have no assurance of a hearty reception from the** cities on the coasts, must be terribly dismayed. \"It","image":false}
