{"text":" B.VIII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 333 encouraging the men of power amongst the Athenians to join their efforts with them for the erection of an oligarchy, though a party was very busy in opposing them, with a view to quash the projected alteration. The Athenians, farther, at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599925\" >Samos<\/span> had in private con- ferences come to a resolution  \" to think no longer.\" of Alcibiades, since he shewed himself so averse to*' join them, and in fact was by no means a proper\"person to have a share in an oligarchical administra-\"tion:   Bur, merely from a principle of self-preser-\"vation, as now they were environed with dangers,*' they should take all possible care that the project:*' should not drop in the execution.   That, farther,\"they should prosecute the war with vigour, and con-\"tribute largely towards it from their own private\"purses, and answer every other exigence of service,*' since, no longer for others, but their own sakes, they*' must continue the struggle.\" Determined, there- fore, to proceed in this manner, they dispatch Pisander and half the former deputation once more to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579885\" >Athens<\/span>, to manage the execution of the project there: To whom, farther, instructions were given, at whatever places in their dependency they should touch upon the voyage, to set up the oligarchy. The other half they sent se- verally about to other of the dependent States. Dio- trephes also, who was now at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550496\" >Chios<\/span>, but appointed to take upon him the command of the Thracian pro- vinces, they ordered away immediately to his post. Diotrephes, upon his arrival at Thasus, dissolved the popular government. And, in the second month at most aster this, the Thasians fortified their city, as men who no longer cared for an aristocracy under Athenian influence, but were in daily expectation of receiving liberty from the Laced  monians: For a number of their countrymen, driven out by the Athenians, were now refuged among the Peloponnesians. These were labouring the point with their correspondents in Tha- sus, to bring off their shipping, and declare a revolt.'The","image":false}
