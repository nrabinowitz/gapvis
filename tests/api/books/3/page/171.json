{"text":" B.VI. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 183 drew up a derree, to send away supplies to chat arma- ment, and a body of horsemen. And here the winter ended; and the seventeenth year of this war, of which Thucydides hath compiled the history, came also to an end. YEAR XVIII.JON the earliest approach of the spring which led on the following summer, the Athenians in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"991353\" >Sicily<\/span>, hoist- ing from Catana, shewed themselves on the coast of Me- gara in Sicily, of Which the Syracusans, having dispos- sessed the inhabitants in the time of Gelon, the tyrant, (as I have already related,) continued mailers of the foil. Having landed here, they ravaged the country; till, approaching a fortress belonging to the Syracusans, and attempting it without success, they retired, some by land and the rest on-board the fleet, into the river Tereas; from whence going again on-shore, they rava- ged the plains and. set fire to the growing corn. Thry also fell in with a small party of Syracusans, some of whom they flew; and then, erecting a trophy, went again on-board. They next returned to Catana; and, aster victualling there, proceeded from thence, with their whole force, to the attack of Centoripa, a strong fort belonging to the Siculj j and, having made them- selves masters of it by a capitulation, they stood away, burning down in their passage the corn of the Inesseans and Hybleans. Upon returning to Catana, they find there two hundred and fifty horiemen arrived from A- thens, though without horses, yet with all the proper furniture, as if they could be better supplied with the former in Sicily; as also thirty archers, mounted, and   three hundred talents in silver.X Before Christ 414, I I","image":false}
