{"text":" 200 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VII. It was the opinion of Nicias, and in general of all the Athenians, that,\" though.it was not their own in-** terest to bring on an engagement, yet it highly con-\"cerned them to put a stop to the counterwork which\"the enemy was raising to hinder their progress:\" For, by this time, the wall of the Syracusans had only not over-reached the extreme point to which the Athenians had brought their circumvallation:\" And, should it** be extended farther, it would give the enemy this dou-** blc advantage;   a certainty of conquest whenever they** thought proper to fight, and a discretionary power\"not to fight at all.\" Determined by these considera- tions, they drew out in order to give the Syracusans battle.

After this, twelve (hips of the Corinthians, and Am- bracicts, and Leucadians, the remainder of the squa- dron designed for this service, having given the Athe- nian guaru-ships the slip, came into the harbour of Sy- racuse: They were commanded by Herasinides, a <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"138251\" >Co<\/span>- rinthian,","image":false}
