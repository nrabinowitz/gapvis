The Sy- racusans in the mean time were pouring their missive weapons upon them from the docks, which were plenti- fully returned by those posted on the raft. In short, the Athenians plucked up most of the piles; but one part of the staccade was exceeding difficult to be demo- lished, as it lay out of fight; for they had driven down.some of the piles in such a manner, that their heads e- merged not above the surface of the water. This ren- dered all access exceeding dangerous; since, ignorant where they lay, a pilot would be apt to bulge his vessel as it were upon a shelve. But even these the divers, for a pecuniary reward, searched out and sawed away. And yet, as fast as this was done, the Syracusans drove down a fresh set of piles. The contrivances both of annoy- ance and prevention were strenuously exerted on both fides, as might justly be expected from two hostile bo- dies posted so near one another; the skirmishings were often renewed, and every artifice of war was successively practised.
