Even Tissaphernes concerned himself now to inflame the Peloponnesian ardour, and promised them larpe supplies. For lately he had been summoned by the king to make returns of the revenue of his government; which not being able to exact from the Grecian cities, because of the Athenians, he was run into a large arrear. He concluded, therefore, that, could he demolish the Athenians, he then with great ease might levy the tributes; what is more, might make the Laced  monians confederates to the king; and might at length convey to him, either aiive or dead, Amor- ges, the bastard-son of Pissuthnes, who had revolted in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"991381\" >Caria<\/span>, as the king had expressly commanded. The Chians, therefore, and Tissaphernes, were now nego- tiating this point in concert. Calligitus, the son of Laophon, a Megarean, and Ti- magoras, the son of Athenagoras, a Cyzicene, both ex- iles from their native places, and refuged with Phar- nabazus, the son of Pharnabacus, arrive at Laced  mon about the same point of time, commissioned by Pharna- bazus to procure an aid of (hipping for the Hellespont, by which he might be enabled (the very same thing as Tissaphernes desired) to work the revolt of the cities within his district from the Athenian obedience, be- cause of the tributes, and expeditioufly to gain for him- self the credit of having procured for his master the al- liance of the Laced  monians. As the agents of Phar- nabazus and those also of Tissaphernes were negotiating the same point; though apart from each other, a great de- bate arose among the statesmen at Laced  mon; one party insisting, with vehemence, that an aid of shipping, and a land force should be sent toTonia and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550496\" >Chios<\/span>; an- other party, that they should be sent first to Hellespont. The Laced  monians, however, complied by far the soon- est with the demands of the Chians and Tissaphernes. Al- cibiades, indeed, espoused the cause of the latter, from an extraordinary zeal to mark hereditary friendship toEn- dius,whoat thisjuncturepresided in thecollege oiEfbori.","image":false}
