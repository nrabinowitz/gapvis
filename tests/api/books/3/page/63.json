{"text":" B.V. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 75 cedaemon. A battle was fought within the precincts of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570106\" >Argos<\/span>, in which the people was the victor: Some of their opponents they flew, and others they doomed to perpetual exile. The Laced  monians, when their adherents implored their succour, were too dilatory in moving; but at last they adjourned the games, and marched away to their support; and hearing, when they were come to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570707\" >Tegea<\/span>, that\"the few were vanquish- ed,\" they determined to proceed no farther, maugre all the intreaties of the new exiles; but, retreating forth- with toSparta,they resumed the celebration of the games. Yet, being afterwards attended by deputations from those in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570106\" >Argos<\/span>, as well as by such as had been lately banished, in the presence of the whole confederacy, af- ter many arguments had been urged on both sides, they came to a resolution, that*' the Argives in the city** were guilty of injustice;\" and a decree was pasted, that\"they should march against Argos.\" But, after all, their proceedings were dilatory and remiss. In the mean time, the people of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570106\" >Argos<\/span>, dreading the Laced  monian strength, and re-addresling themselves 3gain to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579885\" >Athens<\/span> for a renewal of alliance, and proceed- ing to execute a plan which they thought the strongest expedient of preservation, built long walls quite down to the sea, that, in case they should be blocked up by Jand, all proper supplies might be thrown into the city by sea, through the good offices of the Athenians. To this scheme of new fortifications some cities also of Pe- loponnesus were privy underhand. The whole body of the Argives without distinction, the citizens, their wives, and their servants, forwarded the work; and from Athens they were supplied with carpenters and masons. And here the summer ended. Winter now succeeding, the Laced  monians, when advertised of these new fortifications, marched their for- ces against <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570106\" >Argos<\/span>, their own, and all those of their al. lies, excepting the Corinthian. Some new projects in fheir favour were now also in agitation within <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570106\" >Argos<\/span> it- self.","image":false}
