{"text":"*20 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VII. was exemplified in act: They even sell upon the public school, which was a very large one, when the youth of the town were but just got in, and hacked all the children to pieces. And thus this whole city was invol- ved in a calamity, a greater than which no city had ever felt nay, a calamity unexpected and dreadful indeed! The Thebans had no fooner intelligence of it, than they marched to their assistance; but came not up with the Thracians till they were retired to some distance from the town, where they recovered from them their booty, and, having put them to flight, continue the chace down to the Euripus and the sea, where the vessels which had brought them lay at anchor. Here they make a staughter of most of those who endeavoured to get on-board, but could not swim; since the persons left in the vessels, when they law what passed on the shore, put them off beyond their reach. But, in the otherparts of the retreat, the Thracians behaved with some gal- lantry against the Theban horse, which attacked them first since, sallying frequently out on the pursuers, and rallying again after the discipline of their country, they made good their retreat; and thus few of this body were destroyed. A number, farther, who staid behind in the city to plunder, were found there and put to the sword. The whole number of the slain, amongst this body of thirteen hundred Thracians, amounted to two hundred and fifty men; though, in return, they killed, of Thebans, and others who accompanied by way of aid, of horse and heavy-armed together, about twenty, and Skirphondas of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"541138\" >Thebes<\/span>, one of the rulers of B  otia; the lives of some more Mycalessians were also lost in their company. Such was the calamity which fell to the unhappy lot of Mycalesius; and which, for excess of horror, is more to be deplored than any other of the tragical events of this war.
