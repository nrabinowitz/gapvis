Such\"an one must know, that, so long as you are safe, so\"long as you are able to employ the Syracusans, the*' less liable they will be to send reinforcements from\"hence to the Peloponnesians for our annoyance:** And, as this is the real state of things, our concern\"should most largely be bestowed upon you. By pari-*' ty of rtalon it also highly concerns us to replant the*' Leontines; not in order to render them vassals to*' ourselves, as their relations of Eub  a are, but to\"make them as strong and powerful as we are able;*' that, seated as they then will be on her confines,*' they may compensate our remote situation in afford-*' ing a diversion to Syracuse.
