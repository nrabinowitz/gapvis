These, being all of silver, presented to the eye a vast show of wealth, far beyond their intrinsic value. Having also made entertainments in private houses, for those who came in the vessels of the embassy, they amassed together all the gold and silver cups of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"462487\" >Egesta<\/span>; they borrowed others from the ad- jacent cities, as well Ph  nician as Grecian; they carri- ed their guests about from one house of seasting to ano- ther; and each exhibited them as his own property.
