{"text":" 374 THE PELOPONNESlAK WAR. B.VHI. About the same space of time, Alcibiades also* at the head of his squadron of thirteeri sail, returned from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"638796\" >Caunus<\/span> and Phasclis into the harbour of SamoS; report- ing that\" by his management he had diverted the\"junction of the Ph  nician fleet with the Peloponne-\"sians, and made Tissaphernes a faster friend than*' ever to the Athenians.\" After enlarging his squa- dron by the addition of nine more just manned, he le- vied large contributions upon the Halicarnasseans,-ahd fortified <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599728\" >Cos<\/span>. After these exploits, and putting the government of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599728\" >Cos<\/span> into proper hands, he returned a- gain, about autumn, to Samos.* From Aspendus also Tissaphernes rode back post- haste into <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550597\" >Ionia<\/span>, so soon as advised of the departure of the Peloponnesian fleet from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599799\" >Miletus<\/span> for the Helles- pont. Buti as the Peloponnesians were now in the Helles- pont, the Antandrians, (who are of  olic descent,)* As the English reader is here to take his leave of Alcibiades-, he may have the curiosity to know what became of him after.   Every thing succeeded so well, under him and his active collegues, that the Laced  monians, having received several de- feats ooth by land and sea, and lost two hundred ships, were again necessitated to sue for peace. After such great services, Alcibiad-s returned triumphant to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579885\" >Athens<\/span>, The whole city flocked down to the Pir  us to meet hirfc. All strove to get a fight of Alcibiades; they caressed him, crowned him, cursed the authors of his exile, and hurried him away to an assembly of the people. There he harangued them fora tinttj then flopped and ihed teats in abundance; then harangued them again. In fliott, they undid all they had ever done against him; and Alcibiades for a time was all in all at Athens. Yet, in subsf auent commands, he happened not to be successful j 1 crime which his countrymen very seldom forgave. He became a second time an aile from Athens. His great abilities made him a continual terror, both to foreign and domestic enemies.' Yet now he persevered to serve his country, by caballing in their favour, and advising them on critical occasions. Yec all in vain j Lysander was soon master of the Pir  us and of Athens. Alcibiades retired into <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"609502\" >Phrygia<\/span>, and was hand- somely supported by the bounty of his friend Pharnabazus; who however was wrought upon at last, by the joint solicitations of his em mies and the plea of its necessity for the service of the king, to undertake hit destruction. The agents of Pharnabazus durst not attempt him in an open manner, but set fire to his house by night. By-throwing in clothes to damp the flames he got out safe. The Barbarians soon spied him, ihot him to death with arrows and darts, then cut off his bead, and carried it to Pharnabazus. I shall only add, that he was birt forty years old when he was thus destroyed, haying","image":false}
