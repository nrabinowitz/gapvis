Not that they hasted themselves even now to put an utter end to the oligarchical government, but to inforce the necessity of making use of the five thousand not merely in name but in act, and to render the polity more equal. This was, it must be owned, the politi- cal scheme which they all pretended; but, through pri- vate ambition, the majority had given into that course, by which an oligarchy, founded upon the ruins of a de~ mocracy, is ripe for subversion: For it was the daily claim of each single person concerned, not to be equal with the rest, but to be pre-eminently the first; where- as, when out of a democracy a preference is awarded, the distinction is the more easily brooked, as if it were the real consequence os superior worth.

He put the finishing hand to the peace with the Lace- d  monians after the talcing of Athens by Lyfander, when they demolished their long walls, opened their harbours, and gave up their shipping.
