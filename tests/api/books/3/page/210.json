{"text":" 82t THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.Vfl, The embassadors from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"462503\" >Syracuse<\/span>, who were sent round to the Sicilian cities after the surprisal of Plemmyrium, had succeeded in their negotiations; and, having as- sembled a large body of succours, were intent on bring- ing them up.

The Geloans also sent them a squadron of about five sail, beside four hundred darters and two hundred horsemen.
