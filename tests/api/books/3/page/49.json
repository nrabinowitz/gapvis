{"text":" B-V. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 6,t with such Arcadian parties as were already come up, marched on and broke into the Mantinean; and, having formed their camp near the temple of Hercules, they ravaged the country. The Argives and their allies, when their enemy was thus in sight, having posted themselves on a spot of ground by nature strong and difficult of approach, drew up in order, as ready to engage. The Laced  moni- ans also immediately advanced towards them, and even approached so near as within the cast of a stone or a dart. But qne of the old experienced Spartans, perceiving that they were to attack so difficult a post, roared out aloud to Agis,* that\" he was going to repair one evil by an-** other j\" as if, by his present ill-judged eagerness, he was bent on making reparation for his censured retreat from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570106\" >Argos<\/span>.
