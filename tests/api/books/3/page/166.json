{"text":" i78 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VI.\"that the judicious part of our community are sensible\"what fort of a government a democracy is,   and I** myself no less than others, who have such abundant*' occasion to reproach and curse it:   but, for mad-\"ness open and avowed, new terms of abhorrence can-*' not be invented; though totally to subvert it we*' could in no wise deem a measure of security, whilst*' you had declared yourselves our foes, and were in the*' field against us. And all those proceedings of mine,\"which have proved most offensive to you, are to be\"charged entirely to such principles as these.** And now, in relation to these points, on which'* you are here assembled to deliberate, (and I also with\"you,) and about which, if I am able to give you a\"greater light, I am bound to do it,   attend to what'* I am going to declare. Our principal view in the** expedition to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"991353\" >Sicily<\/span> was, if possible, to reduce the\"Sicilians to our yoke. After them, we intended to\"do the same by the Italians. We should next have\"attempted the dominions of the Carthaginians; nay,*' <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"314921\" >Carthage<\/span> itself. Had these our views been succes-\"ful, eithes in the whole or the greater part, we*' should soon have given the attack to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570577\" >Peloponnesus<\/span>;\"assembling for that purpose the whole Grecian force,*' which the countries thus subdued must have added to*' our own; taking also into our pay large bodies of** Barbarians and Iberians, and other soldiers of those*' nations which by general consent are famed for the\"most warlike of all Barbarians. We should have\"built also great numbers of triremes for the enlarge-\"ment of our navy, as <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1052\" >Italy<\/span> would plentifully have*' supplied us with timber; with which blocking up*' <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570577\" >Peloponnesus<\/span> on all sides, and with our land-forces*' at the same time invading it by land, (after carrying\"your cities, some by storm, and some by the regular*' siege,) we hoped without obstruction to have warred\"you down, and in pursuance of that to have seized*' the empire of universal <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1001896\" >Greece<\/span>.
