After these dispositions, and such a descent into the plain, Agis ravaged Saminthusand other places; upon intelligence of which, the Argives, so soon as it was day, dislodged from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570504\" >Nemea<\/span> to stop the depredations, and on their march met with the body of Phiiasians and Corinthians; and, encountering, flew some few of the Phiiasians, whilst not a much greater number of their own men were destroyed by the Corinthians.

Cavalry they had none: For the Athenians were the only part of their confede- racy who were not yet come up.   The bulk, indeed, of the Argives and confederates apprehended not the danger, which at present environ- ed them, to be so great; but rather concluded they might engage with advantage, and that they had caught the Laced  monians fast within their territory, and near to Argos itself. Two Argives, however, Thrasyl- lus, one of the five in command, and Alciphron, the public host of the Laced  monians, the very instant the armies were moving to the charge, had addresied themselves to Agis, and proposed expedients to pre- vent a battle; giving their word, that\"the Argives tf were ready to do and tQ submit to justice, upon a\"fair","image":false}
