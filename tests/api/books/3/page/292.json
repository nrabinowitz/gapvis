In pursuance of this, the Athenians, so soon as thd evening was closed, made the best of their way to Mile- tus, and left the victory imperfect. And the Argives, without making the least stay, chagrined as they were at their late defeat, departed immediately from Samoa to return to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570106\" >Argos<\/span>.

After one day's stay in that harbour, on the next, having augmented their squadron with the Chian ships which had formerly been chaced in company with Chalcideus, they determi- ned to go back again to Teichiussa to fetch off what stores they had landed there. Accordingly, when the\/ were thus returned, Tiflaphernes, being come up with his land-army, persuades them to stand directly against Iasus  in which his enemy Amorges at that instant lay.
