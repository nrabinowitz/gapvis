Nay, they were ready this very moment, upon the strength of what Alcibiades had said, to flight the enemy now at hand, and steer directly for the Pi- r  us. But, though numbers with vehemence recom- mended the step, he stopped their ardour by remon- strances, that\" they ought by no means to think of\"steering for the Pir  us, and leave their nearer ene-\"mies upon their backs: But, in relation to the ope-*' rations of war, since he was elected a general, (he\"said,) he would first go and confer with Tissaphernes, the assembly was no sooner dissolved than he immedi- ately departed, that he might appear in all respects to be perfectly united with Tissaphernes; desirous also to raise himself in his esteem, and give him a sensible proof that he was appointed a general; and, by virtue of this, enabled either to do him service or to do him harm.

The Peloponnesians at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599799\" >Miletus<\/span> had no sooner heard of the recal of Alcibiades, than, as before they suspected treachery in Tissaphernes, they, now loudly vented in- vectives against him. What more inflamed them was, that, ever since the Athenians shewed themselves before <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599799\" >Miletus<\/span> and they had refused to put out to sea and en- gage them, Tissaphernes had flackened more than ever in his payments; and thus, hated by them for that reason sufficiently before, he now became more odious on account of Alcibiades. The soldiery again, as on former occasions, ran together in parties, and enume- rated their grievances. Nay, some of higher ranks, persons of real importance, and not merely the private men, were full of remonstrances, that** they had at*' no time received their full subsistence; his payments u had been always scanty, and even those had never*' been regular: In snort, unless they were led di-*' rectly against the enemy, or carried to some other and would then proceed to action.    * station","image":false}
