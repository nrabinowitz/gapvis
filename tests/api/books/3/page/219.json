{"text":" B.VII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 231 the annoyance which Decelea, now fortified, gave them, the Athenians were arrived before <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"462503\" >Syracuse<\/span> with ano- ther armament as great and as formidable as the for- mer*, and that, in every view, the strength of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579885\" >Athens<\/span> must be quite unsurmountable.
