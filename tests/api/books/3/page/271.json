{"text":" B.VIII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 283 In the beginning of the ensuing winter, animated by the terrible blow the Athenians had received in Sicily, the whole body of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1001896\" >Greece<\/span> was alert against them. li- ven such as had hitherto observed a strict neutrality, without so much as waiting for a formal invitation to accede, thought it incumbent upon themselves no longer to be absent from the war, but voluntarily to enter the lists against the Athenians. Not a State but reasoned thus,   that\" themselves also these Athenians, had they\"succeeded in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"981549\" >Sicily<\/span>, would undoubtedly have attack-\"ed and then concluded,   that,\" as the war for*' certainty was very nearly finished, it would be glo-*' rious for them to have a hand in its completion.'* But the old confederates of the Laced  monians, as their desires were greater, so they exerted themselves now with higher alacrity than ever to procure a speedy relax- ation of their heavy burdens. Yet, in a most remarka- ble manner, such States as were dependent upon <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579885\" >Athens<\/span> manifested their readiness to revolt, even beyond the bounds of caution; since now they formed their judge- ments in all the warmth of indignation, and could dis- cern no probable method by which the Athenians could retard their ruin for another summer. All these circumstances coinciding, the Laced  mo7 nian state became prodigiously alert; and, above all, with the expectation, that their confederates of Sicily, with a powerful reinforcement, as their navies must now of necessity act in concert, would be with them, in all probability, very early in the spring. In every view their hopes were gallant and elate. They determined to go on with the war without any delay; concluding that, if once brought well to a conclusion, they should ever for the future be released from such dangers as had lately threatened from Athens, in case Sicily had been reduced; and, should they now demolish their competi- tors, must remain for the future supreme leaders of Greece, without fear of a reverse.
