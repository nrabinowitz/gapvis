{"text":" B.VI1I. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 301 from Erythr , they consulted how to prevent the exe- cution of the plot by the mildest and most gentle me- thods, either by taking hostages for the sidelity of the suspected, or some other such cautionary expedients. In this posture stood affairs at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550496\" >Chios<\/span>. But, from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579885\" >Athens<\/span>, in the close of the same summer, one thousand five hundred heavy-armed Athenians and a thousand Argives, (for, five hundred Argives, who were but light-armed, the Athenians had equipped in the manner more complete,) with the addition of a thou- sand confederates, in eight and forty fail of ships, in- cluding the transports of the heavy-armed, and put under the command of Phrynichus and Onomacles and Skironidas, sailed away to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599925\" >Samos<\/span>, and, thence stretch- ing over to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599799\" >Miletus<\/span>, encamped themselves before it.
