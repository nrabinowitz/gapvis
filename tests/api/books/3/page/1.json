{"text":" B.V. THE PELO'PONNESIAN WAti. tj| It so fell out indeed, immediately after the battle of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"501347\" >Amphipolis<\/span> and the return of Ramphias from Thessaiy, that neither of the parties meddled any longer with thi operations of war, but were more inclined to a peace. The motives on the Athenian side were these;   They had received a terrible blow at Delium, and a second lately at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"501347\" >Amphipolis<\/span>: Hence they no longer entertain- ed that assured considence of their own strength, which had formerly occasioned them to reject all accOmmoda-1 tions, as they imagined, in their then career of success, they should soon give law to their enemies.

Devasta- tions now were extended over all their country, from Pylus and Cythera. Their Helots had also in numbers deserted to the foe; and they lived in constant expec- tation that those, who yet persevered in their allegiance, gained by the solicitations of those who were fled, might, in the present low ebb of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570685\" >Sparta<\/span>, attempt to subvert their constitution, as had formerly been the case. It happened farther, that the thirty years truce with the Argives was on the point of expiring; and the Argiv.es were unwilling to renew it, unless the Cynuria was previously restored. They judged it therefore a plain impossibility, to make head, at the fame time, a- gainst both Argives and Athenians. They had alia a suspicion","image":false}
