{"text":" B.V. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 3t rinthians and Athenians, without any solemn ratifi- cation. This same summer, the Laced  monians took the field with their whole united force, under the command of Pleistionax, the son of Pausaoias, king of the Lace- d  monians, and marched to the Parrhasians of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570102\" >Arcadia<\/span>. These were subject to the Mantineans, and, in conse- quence of a sedition, had invited this expedition. But it was also designed, if possible, to demolish the fortress of Cypscla, which the Mantineans had erected; and, as it was situated in Parrhasia, towards the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570675\" >Skiritis<\/span> of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570417\" >La<\/span>- conia, had placed a garrison imit. The Laced  mo- nians, therefore, ravaged the terricory of the Parrhasi- ans.

The same summer also, upon the return from- <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"501638\" >Thrace<\/span> of those soldiers who had served under Brasidas, and who came home after the peace under the conduct ot\" Clearidas, the Laced  monians decreed\"those Helots,\"who had served under Brasidas, to be free, and to*' have permission to reside wherever they pleased.'* And, no long time after, they placed them, together with such persons as were newly enfranchised, at Lepre- um: It is situated between <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570406\" >Laconia<\/span> and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570220\" >Elea<\/span>; and- they were now at variance with the Eleans. As for thoie Spartans who had been made prisoners in Sphacteria, and had delivered up their arms, conceiving some fears about them, left, should they lay their late disgrace too much to heart, as they were persons of the greatest rank, they might introduce some innovations in the State, they de- clared them infamous, even though some of the number were, at this time, possessed of posts in the government. But this infamy extended no farther than to disqualify them","image":false}
