{"text":" B.VIL THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 199 appointed to cruize about <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"344424\" >Locri<\/span>, and Rhegium, and the capes of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"981549\" >Sicily<\/span>, in order to intercept them. Gylippus in the mean time was employed in building the counter-wall along EpipoJ , making uie of the stones which the Athenians had laid ready in heaps for the continuation of their own work. It was also his daily custom to draw up the Syracusans and allies in order of battle, and lead them out beyond the point of the counter-wall; which obliged the Athenians to draw up likewise, to observe their motions. And, when Gylippus judged he could attack them with advantage, he instantly advanced; and, the charge being given and received, a battle ensued in the space between their respective works; but so narrow, that no use could be made of the Syracusan and confederate horse. The Sy- racusans and allies were accordingly defeated. They fetched off their slain by truce i and the Athenians e- rected a trophy. But Gylippus, having assembled ihe army round him, thought proper to make this declara- tion in the presence of them all:   That\" the deseat\"was not to be charged on their want of bravery, but*' on his own indiscretion: he had deprived them of*' the service of their own cavalry and darters, by\"ranging his battle in too confined a spot between the*' works: that he would now again lead them out in a** more judicious manner.* He exhorted them there- fore\"to imprint it strong on their remembrance,'* that, as in real strength they were not interior, it\"would be intolerably disgraceful, if they, who to a\"man were Peloponnesians and Dorians, should not\"manifest themselves so resolutely brave, as to con-*' quer and drive out of their country a parcel of Ioni-*' ans and islanders, and a promiscuous rabble of hun-\"gry adventurers.\" Having addressed them thus, he lay on the watch to seize a proper opportunity; and, as soon as he had gained it, led them on again to the charge.O 4 It","image":false}
