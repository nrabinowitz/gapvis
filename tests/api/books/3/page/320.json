Instantly upon this, Dercylidas having completed his march from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599799\" >Miletus<\/span>, Abydus in Hellespont revolts to Dercylidas and Pharnabazus; and two days after <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"501570\" >Lampsacus<\/span> did the fame. But intelligence of this having reached Strombichides at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550496\" >Chios<\/span>, and he, with four and twenty fail of Athe- nians, including the transports which carried the heavy- armed, stretching thither with all possible expedition, the Lampsacenes sallied out to repulse him. He de- feated them in battle; and, having at a shout made himself master of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"501570\" >Lampsacus<\/span>, which was quite unfor- tified, he gave up all the efsects and slaves for pillage to his men; and, after re-establishing such as were free in their old habitations, proceeded against Abydus. But, finding them deaf to all schemes of accommodation, and himself unable to reduce them by force, crossing over to the spot opposite to Abydus, he garrisons Sestus, a city in the Chersonese, which had formerly belonged to the Medes, and put it in a condition to guard the Hellespont. r; During this interval of time, the Chians had very much enlarged their room at sea; and those stationed at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599799\" >Miletus<\/span>, and even Astyochus, upon receiving the par- ticulars of the late engagement, and advice that Strom- bichides was drawn off with so many ships, began to be high in spirits. Astyochus, accordingly, arriving at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550496\" >Chios<\/span> with only two ships, carrieth off along with him what shipping was there, and with the whole force is now at sea, in order to make an attempt upon <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599925\" >Samos<\/span>. But when the enemy there, because mutually embroiled in jealousies, came not out against him, he returned again to the station of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599799\" >Miletus<\/span>: For, about this time, or rather before, the democracy was overturned at A- thens. The deputation, at the head of which was Pifander, were no sooner returned to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599925\" >Samos<\/span> from Tissaphernes, than they found their schemes had gained a stronger footing in the army, and that the Samians had been encouraging","image":false}
