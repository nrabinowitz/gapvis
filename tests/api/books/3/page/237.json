{"text":" B.VII. THE PELOPONNESTAN WAR. 249 several nations of Greek descent settled in Sicily, being all Doric, and independent, acted together in concert. Of the barbarous people they had those <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"462493\" >Siculi<\/span> alone who did not openly revolt to the Athenians; but, out of Sicily, the Laced  monians sent them a citizen of Spar- ta to command, and a body of Neodamodes and Helots. By a Neodamas is meant a citizen newly enfranchised. The Corinthians alone aided them both with shipping and a-land-force, in conjunction with the Leucadians and Ambiaciots, by blood allied to Syracuse. From <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570102\" >Arcadia<\/span> also came a body of mercenaries, sent by the Corinthians and the Sicyonians, who acted on com- pulsion; and of those who dwell without the Pelopon- nesus were the B  otians. But, beside these foreign aids, the Sicilians, as possessed of great and powerful cities, furnished out in all respects a much greater and well-appointed force: For by them a numerous body of heavy-armed, of ships, and horses, and other kinds of military force, in an amazing abundance, were rai- sed and brought to Syracuse. And yet it must be said, that the domestic force of the Syracusans was more to be considered than all the rest, from the greatness of their State and the immediate urgency of those perils with which they were environed. These were the aids, the numerous aids, assembled together by the contending parties; and at this juncture all these were present on each side of the contest; and from this crisis neither party received any accession. The Syracusans therefore and their consederates thought, since the signal victory they had gained upon the water, it would be a brave exploit, and highly for their glory, to make the whole extensive camp of the Athenians their prize, and cut off their retreat on both elements, both by land and lea. With this pro- ject, they immediately barred up the great harbour, the mouth of which is about* eight stadia over, with aP Near a mile. line","image":false}
