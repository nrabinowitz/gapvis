In behalf, therefore, of your country, which\"is now on the brink of more critical dangers than e-\"ver it was known before, hold up your hands in op-*' position, and support what I am going to move;\"namely,   That\" the Sicilians, confining themselves*' within their present limits, which we do not pretend** to abridge, with free navigation along the coast\"of the Ionian gulf, and transacting their own affairs*' at large through the whole extent of the Sicilian seas,\"be at liberty to take care of their own concerns with-'* out any molestation.\"   And, in particular, to return\"the Egesteans the following answer:\"Since,\"without the privity of the Athenians, they have al-'' ready involved themselves in a war against the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"364012\" >Seli<\/span>-\"nuntians, let them also, without the concurrence\"of the Athenians, bring it to a conclusion: That,*' moreover, we shall form no alliance for the future,*' as hath formerly been the case, with men whose indi-*' rest behaviour we must be forced to abet, though,\"when we stand in need of reciprocal assistance from** them, we shail get none at all.\"\"And you, sir, who at present preside in this assem-\"bly, if you are conscious that it is your dury to su-\"perintend the public welfare, if you are desirous to\"behave like a worthy patriot, put the question, and\"call upon the Athenians once more to give their\"votes. And, in cafe you are afraid to act contrary\"to order, in proposing what is counter to a former\"decree; reflect that, when so great a crowd of wit-\"nesses are at hand to justify the ltep, you only act the*' part of a physician to your country, which hath fwal-** lowed down pernicious counsels; and that he best\"dilchargeth the duty of first magistrate, who will\"render to his country all the service he is able; at\"least, with his eyes open, will never suffer it to be*' hurt.\" In","image":false}
