{"text":" Ij4 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VI. The Athenians, with the reinforcements of their al- lies, were by this time all arrived at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"530834\" >Corcyra<\/span>. And the first thing done by the commanders was, to take a re- view of the whole equipment, and to settle the order in which they were to anchor and form their naval sta-, tion. They also divided it into three squadrons, and cast lots for the command of each; to the end that, in the course of the voyage, they might be well supplied with water, and harbours, and the proper necessaries, wherever they might chance to put in; that, in other respects, a better discipline might be kept up, and the men be more inured to a ready obedience, as being under the inspection of an able commander in each several division. These points being settled, they dispatched three vessels to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1052\" >Italy<\/span> and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"991353\" >Sicily<\/span>, to pick up informations, what cities on those coasts would give them a reception. And their orders were, to come back in time and meet them upon the voyage, that they might be advertised into what ports they might safely enter. These previous points being adjusted, the Athenians, with an equipment already swelled to so great a bulk, weighing anchor from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"530834\" >Corcyra<\/span>, stood across for Sicily. The total of their triremes was a hundred and thirty- four, to which were added two Rhodian vessels of fifty oars. One hundred of these were Athenian, and, of this number, sixty were tight ships fit for service; the rest were transports for the soldiery. The remainder of the fleet consisted of Chians and the other allies. The total of the heavy-armed on-board was five thousand one hundred men. Of these, fifteen hundred were citizens of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579885\" >Athens<\/span> inrolled; seven hundred were Athenians of the lowest class, (called Tbetes,) who served by way of marines. The rest of the force consisted of the quotas of their alliance; some, of their own dependents; five hundred belonged to the Argives; the number of Man- tineans and mercenaries was two hundred and fifty; the archers in the whole amounted to four hundred and eighty;","image":false}
