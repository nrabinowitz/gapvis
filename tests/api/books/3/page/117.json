{"text":" B.VI. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 129\"But you, Syracusans, I exhort, to apply your good\"sense on this occasion, and search after probability;\"not by considering such accounts as these men have pompousiy detailed, but such enterprises as a wise and 4t abundantly-enlightened people (for such I esteem the\"Athenians) are likely to undertake. For, whatpro-\"babilky is there, that, leaving the Peloponnesians on** their backs, when the war at home is not yet brought** to any settled conclusion, they would wilfully embark** into another of no less importance? For my part,** I am persuaded they rest well contented, that, so\"many and so powerful States as we Sicilians are, we** have not yet thought proper to invade them.** But, allowing these informations true, and that** they are actually coming,   I am firmly persua-** ded, that <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"991353\" >Sicily<\/span> is better able than Poloponnefus to** war them down, by how much in all respects it is<l better furnished with every resource of war; and** that this our <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"462503\" >Syracuse<\/span> alone is far superior in strength** to that, nay double that armament, which by report** now threatens its invasion. For I know, assuredly,** that no horse can follow in their train; that, farther,** none can be procured for them in this country, if we abate an inconsiderable party which the Egesteans** may furnish. And I know, that a body of heavy-** armed, equal in number to our own, can never be'* transported by them across such a length of sea.-** The enterprize is bold indeed, to attempt so long a** voyage hither with only light and nimble ships, and to bring all those military stores, the roll of which mult** be excessively large, in order to attack so great a city.'** Shall I therefore be terrified at vain reports? I, who am firmly persuaded, that, if the Athenians were** possessed of a city on our coasts as considerable in all\"respects as Syracuse itself, and should dare to pro-** voke us; if masters of the neighbouring territory,** they should from thence make war upon us;   even   f* with such advantages they would with difficulty escape Vol. II.K,\"a total","image":false}
