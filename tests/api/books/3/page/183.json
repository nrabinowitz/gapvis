{"text":" B.VII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 195 Selinuntians also, by a messenger dispatched on pur- pose, they had summoned to meet them, with all their united strength, at a determined place upon their route. The Geloans also, and some of the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"462493\" >Siculi<\/span>, promised to attend with a party, though by no means considerable. The latter of these were disposed better than ever to the service, since Archonides was lately dead, (who, reign- ing over some of the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"462493\" >Siculi<\/span> seated in these parts, and* having a great influence over them, had declared for the Athenians,) and since Gylippus appeared to them to be sent from Laced  mon with a full purpose to do them service.

Find- ing therefore, upon his arrival, that the Syracusans were going forthwith to hold a public assembly, in which the terms of putting an end to the war were de- signed to be adjusted, he dissuaded them from so pre- cipitate a step, and animated their drooping resolutions by strong assurances, that\" other ships would instantly** arrive   \" and that\" Gylippus, the son of Cleandridas,\"was sent thither by the Laced  monians to take upon him the command.\" The Syracusans accordingly resumed their lpirits, and immediately marched outO 2 of","image":false}
