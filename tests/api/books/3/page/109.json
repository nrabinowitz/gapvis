{"text":" B.VI. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. ill  every mariner was a* drachma a day. The number of new ships for the battle and chace was sixty; that of transports for the heavy-armed, forty. The several captains of the triremes were very choice in making up their crews, and gave to such of the mariners as rowed on the uppermost bench, and to the sailors, a gratuity out of their own pockets over and above the public pay.
