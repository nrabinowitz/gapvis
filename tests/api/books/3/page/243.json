{"text":" B.VII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 255 Gylippus, animated their men to engage with resolu- tion, by the following harangue.\"THAT your past achievements have been glorious\"indeed, and for the acquisition of greater honour\"and glory that you are now on the brink of engaging,\"the generality of you, ye Syracusans and confede-\"rates, are well convinced, and need not at present to\"be informed; for otherwise you could never have\"persisted so far in this warm career of bravery and fuc-** cess: But, if there be a man amongst you whose sense** of things drops short of their real position, we shall** now throw upon it the needful illustration.\"This land, our property, the Athenians have inva-** ded; aiming, in the first place, at insiaving <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"991353\" >Sicily<\/span>;** and, had this design succeeded, at inflicting an equal** fate on <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570577\" >Peloponnesus<\/span> and the rest of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1001896\" >Greece<\/span>.
