B.VIIL since he stood in great awe of the Peloponnesians, and adhered to that rule of policy he had learned from him,\"to war both fides out,\"       Alcibiades now had re- course to another piece of resinement, causing Tissa- phernes to insist upon such exorbitant terms that no ac-. commodation could ensue, Tissaphernes, truly, seems to me to have proceeded in this manner from his own voluntary motives, because fear was predominant in him: But in Alcibiades it was purely art; since, as he found the other would not agree upon any terms whate- ver, he affected to strike the conceit into the Athenians that it really was in his power to manage him at plea, sure, and that he was already wrought to their purpose and willing to come to terms, whereas the Athenians would not offer enough.
