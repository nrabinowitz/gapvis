{"text":" B.VI. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 189 an entrenchment along the palisade, entirely to pre- vent the Athenians from continuing their works quite down to the sea. The latter, when they h id perfected their work along the crag, are bent on demolishing the new palisade and intrenchment of the Syracusans. For this purpose, they had ordered their shipping to come about from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"462512\" >Thapsus<\/span> into the great harbour or <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"462503\" >Syracuse<\/span>. They themselves, at the morning's dawn, marched down from Epipolse into the plain; and then, crossing the marsh, where the mud was hardest and best able to bear, by the help of boards and planks which they laid upon the surface, they carry almost the whole length of the palisade and intrenchment early in the morning, and were soon after masters of the whole. This was not effected without a battle, in which the Athenians were again victorious. The routed Syracusans fled different ways; those, who had composed their right, towards the city; and those, who had composed their left, to- wards the river. But, with a view of intercepting the passage of the latter, the three hundred chosen Atheni- ans marched wich all speed to seize the bridge. The Syracusans, alarmed at this step, as this body consisted of the bulk of their horse, face about on the three hun- dred, and put them to flight, and then break in upon the right wing of the Athenians. By so unexpected a shock the first band in thac wing was thrown into dis- order. Lamachus, observing it, advanced to their sup- port from the left, with a small party of archers that happened to be near him, and the whole body of the Argrves. Having crossed a ditch that lay between, se- conded only by a few, whilst the bulk of his parry made a full stop, he is instantly flain j* as were also five* Plutarch, in the life of Nicias, circumstantiates the manner in which this old general lost his life in character, Calibrates, a good soldier, but of great impe- tuosity, rode at the head of the Syracusan horse. Being challenged out by Calibra- tes, Lamachus alone engaged personally with him. Lamachus received the first wound j he then returned the blow, and dropped. His antagonist fell at the fame time, and they both expired together. Or","image":false}
