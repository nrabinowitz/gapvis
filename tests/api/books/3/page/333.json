The soldiers, farther, immediately summoned a general assembly, in which they deposed their former commanders, and all such captains of triremes as fell under their suspicions, and then chose others to fill up the vacancies, both captains of triremes and land-commanders, amongst whom were Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus. The last rose up in the assembly, and encouraged them by every topic of per- suasion; particularly,      that\" they had not the least\"reason to be dispirited, though Athens itscif had re-\"volted from them; for this was merely the secession** of a minority from men whose numbers were greater,*' and who were better furnished for every exigence;** because the whole navy of Athens was their own, by*' which they could compel dependent states to pay in\"their former contingents of tribute as fully as if they*' sailed on such an errand from Athens itself. Even\"yet they were masters of a city at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599926\" >Samos<\/span>, a city despi-*' cable in no respect, but which once in a former war*' had well nigh wrested the empire of the sea from\"the Athenians. The feat of war, in regard to their*' public enemies, would continue the fame as it was*' before, nay, by being masters of the fleet, they** were better enabled to procure all the needful sup-\"plies than their opponents who were now at Athens.*' It was purely owing to their own peculiar situation at\"Samos that the others had hitherto been masters of the*' entrance into the Pir  us; and they soon should be*4 highly distressed if they refused to restore them their*' ancient polity, since these at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599926\" >Samos<\/span> could more easily*' bar them the use of the sea than be barred up by*' them. What assistances Athens had hitherto given*' them against the enemy were but trifling, and of no** real importance. Nothing could be lost from that*' quarter; which was no longer able to supply them** with money, since with that they had been supplied** by the army; nor to send them any valuable instruc-*' tions,","image":false}
