{"text":"'&+ THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.V, in magnifying their own strength, hath been still difbe-* lieved. However, from the following computation, an inquirer may discover the number of the Laced  moni- ans, who on this occasion were drawn up in the field. Besides the Skirit , who were in humber six hundred, seven battalions were in this engagement.'Now in eve- ry battalion there were four companies; and, in every company, four platoons; in the first rank of every platoon. were four fighting soldiers. In regard to depth they were not equally formed, as every colonel determined the depth at his own private discretion; but generally they were drawn up eight deep. The front-line of their whole force, excepting the Skirit , consisted of four hundred and forty-eight men.-f When both sides were ready, the small respite before the engagement was employed by the several comman- ders in animating the soldiers under their respective or- ders. To the Mantineans it was urged, That\" the\"points, for which they were going to fight, were\"their country and their future fate, either rule or fla-\"very; that of rule, whose sweets they had known,\"they might not be divested, and that they might ne-\"ver feel again what slavery is.\" To the Argives, It was\"for their ancient so-\"vereignty, and the equal fliare of dignity they had*' once enjoyed in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570577\" >Peloponnesus<\/span>, now timely to prevent\"an eternal submission to such losses, and earn revenge   f The Laced  monian mura, or brigade, consisted of four hch'i, or battalions,= 2048 men: For a locbos, or battalion, consisted of four fetiueoKa, or companies, ac 512 men; a fer.tecojiy, or company, of four enamalia, or platoons,=128 men i and each tnomatia, or platoon, consisted of 32. This is the account of Thucydides, who computes the platoon by 4 in front and 8 in depth. The platoon consisted there- fore of 32 f which,X by 4,= 128, the number of a company; which, alsoX by 4,~ 512, the number of a battalion. The number of battalions was seven, which shews the number of Laced  monians to have been 3584; and then, with the- addition of 600 Siirittr, who were posted on the left, to have amounted, in the whore, to 4184 men. Or again, the whole front line,= 448,X 8, the number in depth, is equal to 3584,+600 Skirit  ,= 4184. for","image":false}
