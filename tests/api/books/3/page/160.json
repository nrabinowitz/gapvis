And in case, with perfidy open and a-** vowed, we make seizure of your cities, yet we are** unable to retain their possession, remote as they lie** from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579885\" >Athens<\/span>; as cities fo large we never could gar-** rison; and as they are farther provided in all respects** as well as any on the continent. But, on the contra-** ry, the Syraculans will not rush upon you from a** camp upon the beach; but, posted in a city more** formidable in strength than the\" whole of our arma- ment, they are ever meditating your ruin, and, when they have seized a proper oppoitunity, will strike the** blow. They have afforded you instances of this al-\"ready, and a flagrant one indeed in the cafe of the Leontines. And yet they have the effrontery now, by words, as if you were so to be deluded, to exas-\"perate you against us, who have hitherto comrouled\"their views, and deterred them to this moment from** making all Sicily their prey. Our arguments have a tendency directly opposite.** We have nothing in view but your certain and affu-** red prelervation, when we earnestly conjure you not wilfully to betray the mean's which at present will rtf-** suit from our union, which we can mutually exert in** one another's behalf; and strongly to represent to** your own reflexions, thar, even without the concur-\"rence of allies, a road to your reduction will at any** time be open to these Syracusans through their own** superior numbers; but an opportunity exceedingly** seldom afforded you to make head against thettl** with so large an auxiliary body. And if, from** groundless suspicions, you suffer now fo large a body** to depart either unsuccessful or defeated, yet a time will come when you will ardently wish to see them** return, though in a much less proportion of strength,** and they have it no longer in their power to cross the<* lea for your lupport.
