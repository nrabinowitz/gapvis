{"text":" B.VI. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. i8x\"That these or any of these points be executed with\"dispatch and vigour, dependeth, ye Laced  mo-\"nians, on yourselves alone. I can confidently aver*' that all are feasible, and I think I shall not prove mis-M taken in my sentiments. I ought not to suffer in the*' opinion of any Laced  monian, though, once ac-*' counted the warmest of her patriots, I now strenu-*' oufly join the most inveterate foes of my cuuntry;\"nor ought my sincerity to be suspected by any as if I** suited my words to the sharp resentments of an exile,** I am driven from my country, through the malice\"of men who have prevailed against me; but not*' from your service, if you hearken to my counsels.\"Your enmity is sooner to be forgiven, who have hurt*' your enemies alone, than their's, who by cruel treat-\"ment compel friends to be foes.
