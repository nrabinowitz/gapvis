{"text":" 76 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.V. self. The whole army was commanded by Agis, the fon of Archidamus, king of the Laced  monians. The new turns th  y expected for their service took not effect within the city, but they made themselves masters of the new-erected walls, and levelled them with the ground. They also took Hysi , a town in Argia; and, having put all the freemen found within that place to the sword, they drew off, and dispersed to their several cities. After this, the Argives marched their force into Phli- asia; and, after ravaging that district, because the ex- ilcs from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570106\" >Argos<\/span> had met with a reception there, they again retired: For many of those exiles had taken up their residence at Phlius. In the fame winter, the Athenians, exasperated against Perdiccas, prevented all manner of importations into <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"991368\" >Macedonia<\/span>. They charged him\" with taking part in\"the late treaty, confirmed by the sanction of oaths,\"between the Argives and Laced  monians; that, far.\"ther, when they had made great preparations against\"the Chalcideans of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"992078\" >Thrace<\/span> and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"501347\" >Amphipolis<\/span>, and Ni-\"cias, the son ofNiceratus, was appointed to command\"in that service, he had violated his obligations to act** in concert, and that expedition came to nothing pure-\"ly through his secession: He was therefore an enemy\"to Athens.\"... The winter expired in this manner; and with it the fifteenth year of the war came also to an end. YEAR XVI.J WHEN summer came on, Alcibiades, with twenty fail, arrived at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570106\" >Argos<\/span>, where he leized three hundred of the citizens, whose fidelity to the Athenians, and ad- herence to the Laced  monian interest, was still suspect- ed; and these the Athenians secured in the neighbouring islands, which were subject to their dominion.
