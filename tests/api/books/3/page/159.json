{"text":" B.VI. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. i7r\"as you know, that over our dependents in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1001896\" >Greece<\/span>\"we either hold tight or slacken the rein, as squares best** with the public service. We permit to the Chians** and Methymneans the free use of their liberties and** laws for a quota of shipping; we do the same** to many for an annual tribute, exacted perhaps** with somewhat of rigour. Others amongst them,\"who fight under our orders, are absolutely free,** though seated upon islands and easy to be totally re-** duced, because they are commodiously situated to an-\"noy the Peloponnesian coast. And hence it may be** depended upon, that we shall make such dispositions*'   allo here as are most expedient for our own interest,\"and may best lessen the dread, which, as was said be-** fore, we entertain of the Syracusans.\"The point at which they aim is an extent of their** rule over you; and when, by alarming your suspicions** of us, they have wrought you to their own purpose,\"either by open force or taking advantage of your de-** solate condition, when we are repulsed and obliged 1* to abandon your desence, they intend to subdue all** Sicily to their yoke. Such the event will unavoidably** prove, if at present you adhere to them: For, never\"again will it be easy for us to assemble together so** large an armament to give a check to their ambition j** nor, when we are no longer at hand for your support,** will their strength against you be insufficient. It is   * vain in any man to indulge an opinion that this may*s not be the cafe, since the very train of things evin-** ceth its truth. For, when first you invited us hither,** it was not upon the suggestion of any other fear than** this, that, should we suffer you to be subjected by the*f Syracusans, the danger then would extend itself to** us. And highly unjust it would be now, if the argu-** ment you luccessfully inforced with us should lose all its** influence upon you, or should you ground suspicions\"on our present appearance against them with a force.** superior to theirs, when you ought much more to en- 2 certain","image":false}
