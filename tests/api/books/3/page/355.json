In the first moments of this new revolution, Pisander and Alexicles, with their partisans, and in general all the great sticklers for the oligarchy, withdraw privately to Decelea. But Aristarchus, who was one of the ge- nerals of the State, took a different route from all the rest; and, carrying off a party of archers, though rank Barbarians, went off towards Oenoe: Oenoe was a for- tress of the Athenians on the frontiers of B  otia. But the Corinthians, on a provocation peculiar to them- selves, having procured the concurrence of the B  o- tians, held it now blocked up, because a party of their countrymen, drawing off from Decelea, had been put to the sword by a sally of the garrison from Oenoe. A- ristarchus, therefore, having in a conference settled mat- ters with the besiegers, deceives the garrison in Oenoe, by afluring them, that,\" as their, countrymen in A-*' thens had made up all their quarrels with the Lace-\"dasmonians, they also were bound to deliver up this*' place to the B  otians; and that this was an exprese\"provision in the treaty.\" Qiying credit therefore to htm as in public command, and ignorant of all the late transactions because closely blocked up, they agree with the enemy and evacuate the fortress.
