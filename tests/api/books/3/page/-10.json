B.V. soon as the suspension of arms expired, having under his command twelve hundred neavy-armed Athenians, three hundred horsemen, and larger numbers of their allied forces. His whole armament consisted of thirty sail. Touching first at Scione, yet blocked up, he drew from thence the heavy-armed, stationed there as guards; and, standing away, entered the haven of the Colophonians, lying at no great distance from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"501646\" >Torone<\/span>. Being here informed, by the deserters, that Brasidas was not in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"501646\" >Torone<\/span>, nor the inhabitants able to make head against him, he marched his forces by land towards that city, and sent ten of his ships about, to stand into the harbour. His first approach was to the new rampart, which Bra- sidas had thrown up quite round the city, in order to inclose the suburbs within its cincture, and thus, by the demolition of the old wall, had rendered it one intire ci- ty.

Arid, to set it in the most ludicrous view, the poet opens his play with Nieias and Demosthenes, whom he paints in a very injurious manner; and, no doubt, it must have been very grating to them, to fee themselves represented in fo low buffoonery upon the stage at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579885\" >Athens<\/span>.*' Demosthenes begins with a shower\"of curses on that execrable Paphlagonian, Cleon; Nicias seconds him j and, then,<* both of them howl together in a most lamentable duetto.
