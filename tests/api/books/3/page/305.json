{"text":" B.VIII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 317 having laid their ships aground, continued with them eighty days without subjecting them to any farther im- position. During this interval of time, nay, extended farther back, before they undertook this enterprise against <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"590030\" >Rhodes<\/span>, the following transaction happened: Alcibiades, after the death of Chalcideus and the bat- tle of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599799\" >Miletus<\/span>, falling under the suspicion of the Pelo- ponnesians, and through them a letter having been sent from Laced  mon to Astyochus to put him to death,   for he was an enemy to Agis, and his treachery in other respects was become notorious,   Alcibiades, s say, fearful of his life, withdraws himself first to Tissapher- nes, and, in the next place, did all in his power to un- dermine what interest the Peloponnesians had in him. Grown at length his dictator in every affair, he abridged their pay; that, instead of an Attic* drachma, three 0- boli only should be given them, and that too with no punctuality. He advised Tissaphernes to remonstrate with them, that\" the Athenians, who through a long\"tract of time had gained experience in naval affairs,\"paid only three oboli to their seamen,   not so much tf through a principle of frugality, as to prevent their** seamen from growing insolent through too much'* plenty; some of them would otherwise render their'* bodies less fit for fatigue, by having wherewithal to*c purchase those pleasures by which weakness is occa-\"stoned; and others would desert, and leave their ar-*' rears to balance their desertion.\" He instructed him, farther, how, by seasonable gratuities to the comman- ders of ships and generals of the States, he might per- suade them all to acquiesce in his proceedings, except- ing the Syracusans; for, amongst these, Hermocrates alone made loud remonstrances in behalf of the whole alliance. Nay, Alcibiades himself took upon him to give the denial to such States as petitioned lor money;* Six oboli, or 7'\/.\\ Sterling. making","image":false}
