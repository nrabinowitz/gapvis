{"text":" B.VI. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 179\"needful stores, adequate to this extensive plan, the** cities to be conquered in those remoter parts would\"with all proper expedition have supplied us, without\"any demands on our own domestic revenues. Such were to be the atchievements of that grand armament** which is now abroad; such, you may rest assured\"upon the evidence of a person who was privy to every\"step, was its original plan; and the generals who are** left in the command will yet, if they are able, carry\"it into execution. And I must farther beg leave to** tell you, that, if with timely succours you do not** interpose, nothing in those parts will be able to stand** before them.\"The Sicilians are a people unexperienced in war;\"and yet, would they unite and combine together in\"their mutual defence, they might possibly even now\"be too hard for the Athenians. But then the Syra-\"cusans, abandoned as they are by the rest, and who** already have leen their whole force defeated in battle,** and who are blocked up in their own harbours by the\"enemy's fleet, will be unable long to resist the great** force of the Athenians which is already there. If,\"therefore, <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"462503\" >Syracuse<\/span> be taken, all Sicily is vanquished** at a stroke, and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1052\" >Italy<\/span> becometh instantly their prey; f* and then the storm, which, as I intimated before,** was to be directed against you from that quarter,\"will in a short time gather, and come pouring down** upon you.\"Let no one therefore imagine that the end of your** present deliberation is the lasety of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"981549\" >Sicily<\/span>, when Pe-\"loponnesus itself will be endangered, unless some\"measures of prevention be execuced with speed;  ** unless you send out a naval force, for the preferva-\"tion.of Sicily, so dexterously appointed, that the\"hands, who man the ships and ply the oar, may,\"on the instant of their landing, become a body of** heavy-armed; and,, what in my judgement is better\"than an army, a citizen of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"570406\" >Sparta<\/span> to take upon himN 2** the","image":false}
