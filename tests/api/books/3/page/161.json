{"text":" B.VI. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 173 rineans, that neither yourselves nor others be decei-** ved by a too credulous belief of the bold calumnia-** tions these Syracusans utter. We have now laid be-\"fore you the true ground of all those sad suspicions\"which are fomented against us; but shall again recal** them to your remembrance by a short recapitulation,\"that they may have the proper influence upon you.\"We declare, therefore, that we rule in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1001896\" >Greece<\/span>\"merely to prevent our being inflaved; but are intent\"on vindicating liberty in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"981549\" >Sicily<\/span>, to suppress that an-** noyance which might otherwise be given us from\"hence;   that mere necessity obligeth us to embark in t* many undertakings, because we have many sinister** incidents to guard against;   that now and formerly** we came hither to support those Sicilians who have\"been unjustly oppressed; not uninvited, but solemnly** conjured to take such steps. Attempt not, there-** fore, to divert our pursuits, either by erecting your-\"stives into censors of our proceedings, or into correc-\"tors of our politics, a point too disficult for you to\"manage. But, so much of our activity or conduct** as you can mould into a consistency with your own** welsare, lay hold of that, and employ it to your best** advantage; and never imagine that our politics are\"equally prejudicial to all the world besides, but high-\"ly benesicial to the bulk of the Grecians. For,** through every quarter, even those which we cannot** pretend to controul, both such as dread impending** mischiefs and such as meditate incroachments,   lay-\"ing hold on both sides of the ready expectation; the** former, that redress may be obtained by our interpo-\"fition; the latter, that, if we think proper to oppose** them, their own sasety will be greatly endangered;   '** both sides, I fay, are hence obliged; the latter, to** practise moderation, though with regret; the former*** to enjoy tranquillity without previous embroilments\"of the public peace. The security, therefore, which** now offers itself to your acceptance, and is alwaysV ready","image":false}
