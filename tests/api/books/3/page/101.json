Nor is it, farther, to be\"presumed, that they will readily exchange their ownM liberty for subjection to us, as they are numerous, ac\"least for one island, and many of them inhabited by\"Grecians. For, without reckoning <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"462387\" >Naxus<\/span> and Ca-M tana, which I hope, upon account of their affinity to** the Leontines, will side with us, there are no less than*' seven provided in all respects with as good martial ha-\"biliments and stores as our own armies\\ and more\"particularly those against which we chiefly bend our\"course, <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"462489\" >Selinus<\/span> and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"462503\" >Syracuse<\/span>. These cities abound with*' soldiers heavy-armed, with archers, and with darters.*' They have a great number of triremes, and plenty\"of hands toman them. They possess a large quanti-\"ty of wealth, not only in private purses, but in their\"public treasuries. So rich are even the Selinuntians.*' And to the Syracusans, farther, a tribute is paid by*' several barbarians. But the points, in which they'* most of all excel us, are, that numerous cavalry\"of which they are possessed, and corn of their own*' growth sufficient to answer all demands without fo-*' reign importations. An armament, therefore, sini-\"ply naval, will by no means be sufficient to cope with\"such a strength. A large land force must accompa-\"ny the naval, if we are desirous of performing such\"atchievements as may be worthy the greatnelsof our\"plan, and would not be debarred an opportunity** of landing by their numerous cavalry. And this will*' be yet more needful, should the cities, alarmed at** our approach, combine together against us, and no'* other friends but the Egesteans join us, or supply us\"with a body of cavalry sufficient to countenance our\"landing. It would be a terrible disgrace, should we\"be compelled by force to give over our design, or to*' send for a larger supply, as if our councils at first fet-\"ting-out were rash and ill-concerted. We must steer'* ar once against them with preparations in all respects Vol. II. I*' well-","image":false}
