{"text":" B.VII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 325 thenians erected a trophy. The spot they chose, whereon to place this token of their victory, was distant about   twenty stadia from Erineus, the station in which the Corinthians rode. Such was the event of this naval en- gagement.   ' Demosthenes and Eurymedon, so soon as the Thu- rians had got in readiness seven hundred heavy-armed, with three hundred darters to attend them in the expe- dition, ordered the fleet to coast along the shore to- wards the Crotoniatis; whilst themselves, after having taken a review of all their land-army upon the banks ot the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"452459\" >Sybaris<\/span>, marched them over land through the Thuriatis.

The next morning they re-embarked and proceeded along the coast, touching at every city except <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"344424\" >Locri<\/span>, till they arrived at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550816\" >Petra<\/span> in the district of Rhegium. But, during this interval, the Syracusans, who had received advice of the approach of the reinforcement, determined to make another attempt with their fleet and the whole augmented body of their land-army, which they had assembled together for this very design of at- tacking the Athenians again before the reinsorcement arrived. But, like men who in\"the former action had clearly perceived what would give them advantages over the enemy, they had made some alteration in the struc- ture of their vessels: Having shortened the heads of their ships, they made them more firm and compact, and fastened very substantial stays to each fide of the beak; they strengthened these again by rafters of six cubits in length, which were laid along the ribs both* About two miles.
