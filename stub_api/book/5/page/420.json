{"text": " m TH E DECUN E AN D KAU. Arabians disdained the study of any foreign idiom. The Greek interpreters were chosen among their Christian subjects; they formed the translations, sometimes on the original text, more frequently perhaps on a Syriac version; and in the crowd of astronomers and physicians, there is no example of a poet, an orator, or even an historian, being taught to speak the language of the Saracens.(l) The mytho- logy of Homer would have provoked the abhorrence of those stern fanatics; they possessed in lazy ignorance the colonies of the Macedonians, and the provinces of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"314921\">Carthage</span> and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"423025\">Rome</span>: theiheroes of Plutarch and Livy were buried in oblivion; and the history of the world before Mahomet was reduced to a short legend of the pa- triarchs, the prophets, and the Persian kings. Our education in the Greek and J.atin schools may have fixed in our minds a standard of exclusive taste; and I am not forward to condemn the literature and judgments of nations, of whose language 2 am ignorant. Yet I know that the classics have much to teach, and I believe that the orientals have much to learn: the temperate dignity of style, the graceful pro- portions of art, the forms of visible and intellectual beauty, the just delineation of character and passion, the rhetoric of narrative and argument, the regular fabric of epic and dramatic poetry. (2) The influence of truth and reason is of a less ambiguous complexion. The philosophers of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"579885\">Athens</span> and Rome enjoyed the bless- ings and asserted the rights, of civil and religious freedom. Their moral and po- litical writings might have gradually unlocked the fetters of eastern despotism, diffused a liberal spirit of inquiry and toleration, and encouraged the Arabian sages to suspect that their caliph was a tyrant and their prophet an impostor. (3) The instinct of superstition was alarmed by the introduction even of the abstract sci- ences; and the more rigid doctors of the law condemned the rash and pernicious curiosity of Almamon.(4) To the thirst of martyrdom, the vision of paradise, and the belief of predestination, we must ascribe the invincible enthusiasm of the prince and people. And the sword of the Saracens became less formidable, when their youth was drawn away from the camp to the college, when the armies of the faithful presumed to read and to reflect. Yet the foolish vanity of the Greeks was jealous of their studies, and reluctantly imparted the sacred fire to the barbarians of the east. (5) In the bloody conflict of the Ommiades and Abbassides, the Greeks had stolen the opportunity of avenging their wrongs, and enlarging their limits. But a severe retribution was enacted by Mohadi, the third caliph of the new dynasty, whoseized Jn his turn the favourable opportunity, while a woman and a child, Irene and Con- stantine, were seated on the Byzantine throne. An army of ninety-five thousand Persians and Arabs was sent from the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"874545\">Tigris</span> to the Thracian <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"520977\">Bosphorus</span>, under the command of Harun,(6) or Aaron, the second son of the commander of the faith- ful His encampment on the opposite heights of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"520995\">Chrysopolis</span> or Scutari, informed Irene, in her palace of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"520985\">Constantinople</span>, of the loss of her troops and provinces. With the consent or connivance of their sovereign, her ministers subscribed an ig- nominious peace; and the exchange of some royal gifts could not disguise the an- nual tribute of seventy thousand dinars of gold, which was imposed on the Roman empire. The Saracens had too rashly advanced into the midst of a distant and hostile land: their retreat was solicited by the promise of faithful guides and plen- tiful markets; and not a Greek had courage to whisper, that their weary forces night be surrounded and destroyed in their necessary passage between a slippery mountain and the river Sangarius. Five years after this expedition, Harun ascend- ed the throne of his father, and his elder brother; the most powerful and vigorous as, by Tbeophilns, a yards the end of the do not believe, that (1) Abnlpharagius, (Dynast, p. 25.148.) mentions a Syriac version of Homer** two poems, by\" Christian Maronite of mount Libanus, who protested astronomy at Roha or <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"658457\">Edessa</span>, towr-1-  lghth century.

At present, in the maturity of his taste and judgment, be would perhaps abate of thefervent, and even partial, praise which be has bestowed on Ibe orientals. (3) Among the Arabian philosophers, Averroes has been accused of despising the religion of the Jews, the Christians, and the Mahometans, (See his article in Bayle's Dictionary.) Each of these sects would agree, that in two instances out of three, his contempt was reasonable. (4) D'Herbelot, Brbliotheque Orientate, p. 543.
