{"text": " 62 TH E DECLIN E AN D FAL L prayers and pilgrimage of Datius, bishop of Milan, were not without effect; and he obtained one thousand Thracians and Isaurians, to assist the revolt of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"383698\">Liguria</span> against her Arian tyrant. At the same time, John the Sanguinary,(1) the nephew of Vitalian, was detached with two thousand chosen horse, first to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"118551\">Alba</span> on the Fucine lake, and afterward to the frontiers of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"413253\">Picenum</span> on the Hadriatic sea.\" la   that province,\" said Belisarius,\" the Goths have deposited their families and trea- sures without a guard or the suspicion of danger. Doubtless they will violate the truce; let them feel your presence, before they hear of your motions. Spare the Italians; suffer not any fortified places to remain hostile in your rear; and faithfully reserve the spoil for an equal and common partition. It would not be reasonable (he added with a laugh,) that whilst we are toiling to the destruction of the drones, our more fortunate brethren should rifle and enjoy the honey.\" The whole nation of the Ostrogoths had been assembled for the attack, and was almost entirely consumed in the siege of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"423025\">Rome</span>. If any credit be due to an intelli- gent spectator, one-third at least of their enormous host was destroyed, in frequent and bloody combats under the walls of the city. The bad fame and pernicious qualities of the summer air, might already be imputed to the decay of agriculture and population; and the evils of famine and pestilence were aggravated by their own licentiousness, and the unfriendly disposition of the country. While Vitiges struggled with his fortune; while he hesitated between shame and ruin, his retreat was hastened by domestic alarms. The king of the Goths was informed by trem- bling messengers, that John the Sanguinary spread the devastations of war from the Apennine to the Hadriatic; that the rich spoils and innumerable captives of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"413253\">Picenum</span> were lodged in the fortifications of Rimini; and that this formidable chief had defeated his uncle, insulted his capital, and seduced, by secret correspondence, the fidelity of his wife, the imperious daughter of Amalasontha. Yet, before her retired, Vitiges made a last effort either to storm or to surprise the city. A secret passage was discovered in one of the aqueducts; two citizens of the Vatican were tempted by bribes to intoxicate the guards of the Aurelian gate; an attack was meditated on the walls beyond the Tiber, in a place which was not fortified with, towers; and the barbarians advanced, with torches and scaling-ladders, to the as- sault of the Pincian gate. But every attempt was defeated by the intrepid vigi- lance of Belisarius, and his band of veterans, who, in the most perilous moments, did not regret the absence of their companions; and the Goths, alike destitute of hope and subsistence, clamorously urged their departure, before the truce should expire, and the Roman cavalry should again be united. One year and nine days after the commencement of the siege, an army so lately strong and triumphant, burnt their tents, and tumultuously repassed the Milvian bridge. They repassed not with impunity: their thronging multitudes, oppressed in a narrow passage, were driven headlong into the Tiber by their own fears and the pursuit of the ene- my; and the Roman general, sallying from the Pincian gate, inflicted a severe and disgraceful wound on their retreat. The slow length of a sickly and desponding host was heavily dragged along the Flaminian way; from whence the barbarians were sometimes compelled to deviate, lest they should encounter the hostile garri- sons that guarded the high road to Rimini and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"393480\">Ravenna</span>. Yet so powerful was this flying army, that Vitiges spared ten thousand men for the defence of the cities which he was most solicitous to preserve, and detached his nephew Uraias, with an adequate force, for the chastisement of rebellious Milan. At the head of his principal army, he besieged Rimini, only thirty-three miles distant from the Go- thic capital. A feeble rampart, and a shallow ditch, were maintained by the skill and valour of John the Sanguinary, who shared the danger and fatigue of the mean- est soldier, and emulated, on a theatre less illustrious, the military virtues of his great commander. The towers and battering engines of the barbarians were ren- dered useless; their attacks were repulsed; and the tedious blockade, which re- duced the garrison to the last extremity of hunger, afforded time for the union and march of the Roman forces. A fleet which had surprised <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"413014\">Ancona</span>, sailed along the coast of the Hadriatic, to the relief of the besieged city. The eunuch Narses landed in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"413253\">Picenum</span> with two thousand <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"98980\">Heruli</span>, and five thousand of the bravest troops of the east. The rock of the Appennine was forced; ten thousand veterans moved round the foot of the mountains, under the command of Belisarius himself; and a new army, whose encampment blazed with innumerable lights, afifieared^to advance along the Flaminian way.
