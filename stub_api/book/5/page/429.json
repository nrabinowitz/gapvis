{"text": " O F TH E ROMA N EMPIRE* of the faithful, But in the long and hereditary exercise of power, they assumed the pride and attributes of royalty; the alternative of peace or war, of reward or punishment, depended solely on their will; and the revenues of the government were reserved for local services or private magnificence. Instead of a regular supply of men and money, the successors of the prophet were flattered with the ostentatious gift of an elephant, or a cast of hawks, a suit of silk hangings, or some pounds of musk and amber. (1) After the revolt of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1027\">Spain</span>, from the temporal and spiritual supremacy of the Ab- bassides, the first symptoms of disobedience broke forth in the province of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"324852\">Africa</span>. Ibrahim, the son of Aglab, the lieutenant of the vigilant and rigid Harun, be- queathed to the dynasty of the ylglabites the inheritance of his name and power, The indolence or policy of the caliphs dissembled the injury and loss, and pursued only with poison the founder of the lidrisites,{2) who erected the kingdom and city of Fez on the shores of the western ocean. (3) In the east, the first dynasty was that of the Taheri  es;(4) the posterity of the valiant Taher, who, in the civil wars of the sons of Harun, had served with* too much zeal and success the cause of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"206907\">Alma</span>- mon, the younger hrnther. He was sent into honourable exile, to command on the banks of the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"59969\">Oxus</span>; and the independence of his successors, who reigned in Cho- rasan till the fourth generation, was palliated by their modest and respectful de- meanour, the happiness of their subjects, and the security of their frontier. They were supplanted by one of those adventurers so frequent in the annals of the east, who left his trade of a brazier (from whence the name of Sqffarides) for the profes- sion of a robber. In a nocturnal visit to the treasure of the prince of Sistan, Jacob, the son of Leith, stumbled over a lump of salt, which he unwarily tasted with his tongue. Salt, among the orientals, is the symbol of hospitality, and the pious rob- ber immediately retired without spoil or damage. The discovery of this honou- rable behaviour recommended Jacob to pardon and trust; he led an army at first for his benefactor, at last for himself, subdued Persia, and threatened the residence of the Abbassides. On his march towards Bagdad, the conqueror was arrested by a fever. He gave audience in bed to the ambassador of the caliph; and be- side him on a table were exposed a naked scimitar, a crust of brown bread and a bunch of onions.\" If I die,\" said he,\" your master is delivered from his fears. If I live, this must determine between us. If I am vanquished, I can return with- out reluctance to the homely fare of my youth.\" From the height where he stood, the descent would not have been so soft or harmless; a timely death secured his own repose and that of the caliph, who paid with the most lavish concessions the retreat of his brother Amrou to the palaces of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"922706\">Shiraz</span> and Ispahan. The Abbas- sides were too feeble to contend, too proud to forgive; they invited the powerful dynasty of the Samanidcs, who passed the Oxus with ten thousand horse, so poor, that their stirrups were of wood; so brave, that they vanquished the Soffarian army, eight times more numerous than their own. The captive Amrou was sent in chains, a grateful offering to the court of Bagdad; and as the victor was content   with the inheritance of Transoxiana and Chorasan, the realms of Persia returned for awhile to the allegiance of the caliphs. The provinces of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"531109\">Syria</span> and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"766\">Egypt</span>   were twice dismembered by their Turkish slaves, of the race of Toulon and Ik- shid. (5) These barbarians, in religion and manners, the countrymen of Mahomet, emerged from the bloody factions of the palace to a provincial command and an independant throne: their names became famous and formidable in their time; but the founders of these two potent dynasties confessed, either in words or actions, the vanity of ambition. The first on his death-bed implored the mercy of God to (1) The dynasties of the Arabian empire may he studied in the Annals of Elmacin, Abnlpharagius, and Abulfeda, under ihe proper years; in the dictionary of d'Herbelot, under the proper names. The tables of M, de Gtiignes (Hist des Huns, torn. i. exhibit a general chronology of the east, interspersed with some historical anecdotes; but his attachment to national blood has sometimes confounded the order of time and place.
