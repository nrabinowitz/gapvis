{"text": " 10-1 TH E DECLIN E AN D FAL L of the Gothic kingdom: the senate and people were restored to their country; the means of subsistence were liberally provided; and Totila, in the robe of peace, exhibited the equestrian games of the circus. Whilst he amused the eyes of the multitude, four hundred vessels were prepared for the embarkation of his troops. The cities of Rhegium and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"442810\">Tarentum</span> were reduced: he passed into Sicily, the ob- ject of his implacable resentment, and the island was stripped of its gold and sil- ver, of the fruits of the earth, and of an infinite number of horses, sheep, and oxen. <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"472014\">Sardinia</span> and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"991339\">Corsica</span> obeyed the fortune of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1052\">Italy</span>; and the sea-coast of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1001896\">Greece</span> was visited by a fleet of three hundred galleys. (1) The Goths were landed in <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"530834\">Corcyra</span> and the ancient continent of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"530871\">Epirus</span>; they advanced as far as <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"531013\">Nicopolis</span>, the trophy of Augustus, and Dodona,(2) once favoured by the oracle of Jove. In every step of his victories the wise barbarian repeated to Justinian his desire of peace, applauded the concord of their predecessors, and offered to employ the Gothic arms in the service of the empire. Justinian was deaf to the voice of peace; but he neglected the prosecution of war; and the indolence of his temper disappointed, in some degree, the obstinacy of his passions. From this salutary slumber the emperor was awakened by the pope Vigilius and the patrician Cethegus, who appeared before his throne, and adjured him, in the name of God and the people, to resume the conquest and deliverance of Italy. In the choice of the generals, caprice as well as judgment was shown. A fleet and army sailed for the relief of Sicily under the conduct of Liberius; but his youth and want of experience were afterwards discovered, and before he touched the shores of the island, he was overtaken by his successor. In the place of Liberius, the conspirator Artaban was raised from a prison to military honours; in the pious presumption, that gratitude would animate his valour and fortify his allegiance. Belisarius reposed in the shade of his laurels, but the command of the principal army was reserved for Germanus,(3) the emperor's nephew, whose rank and merit had been long depressed by the jealousy of the court. Theodora had injured him in the rights of a private citizen, the marriage of his children, and the testament of his brother; and although his conduct was pure and blameless, Justinian was displeased that he should be thought worthy of the confidence of the malecontents. The life of Germanus was alesson of implicit obe- dience; he nobly refused to prostitute his name and character in the factions of the circus: the gravity of his manners was tempered by innocent cheerfulness; and his riches were lent without interest to indigent or deserving friends. His valour had formerly triumphed over the Sclavonians of the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"216798\">Danube</span> and the rebels of Af- rica: the first report of his promotion revived the hopes of the Italians: and he was privately assured, that a crowd of Roman deserters would abandon, on his ap- proach, the standard of Totila. His second marriage with Malasontha, the grand-daughter of Theodoric, en- deared Germanus to the Goths themselves; and they marched with reluctance against the father of a royal infant, the last offspring of the line of Amali.(4) A splendid allowance was assigned by the emperor: the general contributed his pri- vate fortune; his two sons were popular and active; and he surpassed in the promp- titude and success of his levies, the expectation of mankind. He was permitted to select some squadrons of Thracian cavalry: the veterans as well as the youth of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"520985\">Constantinople</span> and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"991376\">Europe</span>, engaged their voluntary service; and as far as the heart of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"481844\">Germany</span>, his fame and liberality attracted the aid of the barbarians. The Romans advanced to Sardica; an army of Sclavonians fled before their march; but within two days of their final departure, the designs of Germanus were termi- nated by his malady and death. Yet the impulse which he had given to the Ita- lian war still continued to act with energy and efl'ect.

Eustathius had supposed it to be the fanciful likeness of a rock.
