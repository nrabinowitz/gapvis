The consternation of the fugitives had already dif- fused the terror of his name; but the fancied riches of Bagdad had already been dissipated by the avarice and prodigality of domestic tyrants. The prayers of the people, and the stern demands of the lieutenant of the Bowides, required the ca- liph to provide for the defence of the city. The helpless Mothi replied, that his arms, his revenues, and his provinces, had been torn from his hands, and that he was ready to abdicate a dignity which he was unable to support. The emir waa inexorable; the furniture of the palace was sold; and the paltry price of forty thou- sand pieces of gold was instantly consumed in private luxury. But the apprehen- sions of Bagdad were relieved by the retreat of the Greeks; thirst and hunger guarded the desert of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1001936\">Mesopotamia</span>: and the emperor, satiated with glory, and laden with oriental spoils, returned to <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"520985\">Constantinople</span>, and displayed, in his tri- umph, the silk, the aromatics, and three hundred myriads of gold and silver. Yet the powers of the east had been bent, not broken, by this transient hurricane. After the departure of the Greeks, the fugitive princes returned to their capitals; the subjects disclaimed their involuntary oaths of allegiance; the Moslems again purified their temples, and overturned the idols of the saints and martyrs; the Nes- torians and Jacobites preferred a Saracen to an orthodox master; and the num- bers and spirit of the Melchites were inadequate to the support of the church and state. Of these extensive conquests, Antioch, with the cities of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"981514\">Cilicia</span> and the isle of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"991392\">Cyprus</span>, was alone restored, a permanent and useful accession to the Ro- man empire.(l) (1) See the Annals of Elmacin.
