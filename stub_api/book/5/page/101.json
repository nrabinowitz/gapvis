{"text": "' O F TH E ROMA N EMPIRE. 89 thousand years by Shah Abbas, the wisest and most powerful of his successors. (1) His ambition was fired by the hope of launching a Persian navy from the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"863867\">Phasis</span>, of commanding the trade and navigation of the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1224\">Euxine</span> <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1224\">sea</span>, of desolating the coast of Pontus and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"511189\">Bithynia</span>, of distressing, perhaps of attacking, <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"520985\">Constantinople</span>, and of persuading the barbarians of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1001887\">Europe</span> to second his arms and counsels against the common enemy of mankind. Under the pretence of a Scythian war, he si- lently led his troops to the frontiers of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"863807\">Iberia</span>; the Colchian guides were prepared to conduct them through the woods and along the precipices of mount <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"863766\">Caucasus</span>; and a narrow path was laboriously formed into a safe and spacious highway, for the march of cavalry, and even of elephants. Gubazes laid his person and dia- dem at the feet of the king of Persia; his Colchians imitated the submission of their prince: and after the walls of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550816\">Petra</span> had been shaken, the Roman garrison prevented, by a capitulation, the impending fury of the last assault. But the Lazi soon discovered, that their impatience had urged them to choose an evil more in- tolerable than the calamities which they strove to eacape. The monopoly of salt and corn was effectually removed by the loss of those valuable commodities. The authority of a Roman legislator was succeeded by the pride of an oriental despot, who beheld with equal disdain, the slaves whom he had exalted, and the kings   whom he had humbled before the footstool of his throne. The adoration of fire   was introduced into Colchos by the zeal of the Magi: their intolerant spirit pro- voked the fervour of a Christian people; and the prejudice of nature or education was wounded by the impious practice of exposing the dead bodies of their parents, on the summit of a lofty tower, to the crows and vultures of the air. (2) Con- scious of the increasing hatred, which retarded the execution of his designs, the just Nushirvan had secretly given orders to assassinate the king of the Lazi, to transplant the people into some distant land, and to fix a faithful and warlike colo- ny on the banks of the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"863867\">Phasis</span>. The watchful jealousy of the Colchians foresaw and averted the approaching ruin. Their repentance was accepted at Constanti- nople by the prudence, rather than the clemency, of Justinian; and he commanded Dagisteus with seven thousand Romans, and one thousand of the Zani, to expel the Persians from the coast of the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"638838\">Euxine</span>. siege of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550816\">Petra</span>, which the Roman general, with the aid of the Lazi, imme- undertook, is one of the most remarkable actions of the age. The city was on a craggy rock, which hung over the sea, and communicated by a steep and narrow path with the land. Since the approach was difficult, the attack might be deemed impossible; the Persian conqueror had strengthened the fortifications of Justinian; and the places least inaccessible were covered by additional bulwarks. In this important fortress, the vigilance of Chosroes had deposited a magazine of offensive and defensive arms, sufficient for five times the number, not only of the garrison, but of the besiegers themselves. The stock of flour and salt provisions   was adequate to the consumption of five years; the want of wine was supplied by vinegar, and of grain, from whence a strong liquor was extracted; and a triple aqueduct eluded the diligence, and even the suspicions, of the enemy. But the firmest defence of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550816\">Petra</span> was placed in the valour of fifteen hundred Persians, who resisted the assaults of the Romans, whilst in a softer vein of earth a mine was se- cretly perforated. The wall, supported by slender and temporary props, hung tottering in the air; but Dagisteus delayed the attack till he had secured a specific recompense; and the town was relieved before the return of his messenger from Constantinople. The Persian garrison was reduced to four hundred men, of whom no more than fifty were exempt from sickness or wounds; yet such had been their inflexible perseverance, that they concealed their losses from the enemy, by en- during, without a murmur, the sight and putrifying stench of the dead bodies of their eleven hundred companions. After their deliverance, the breaches were hastily stopped with sand-bags; the mine was replenished with earth; a new wall was erected on a frame of substantial timber; and a fresh garrison of three thou- sand men was stationed at <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"550816\">Petra</span>, to sustain the labours of a second siege. The ope- (1) See the amusing letters of Pietro della Valle.the Roman traveller (Viagsi, torn. ii. p. 207.209.213.215. 266.286.300. torn.iii. p.54. 127.) In tbe year 1611,1619, and 1620, he conversed with Shah Abbas, and strongly encouraged a design which might have united Persia and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1001887\">Europe</span> against their common enemy the Turk.

This practice,agreeableto the Zen- rlavesta (Hyde, de Relig. Pers. c. xxxiv. p. 414   421.,) demonstrates that the burial of the Persian kings (Xeno- phon.
