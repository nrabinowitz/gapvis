{"text": " O F TH E ROMA N EMPIRE. 17$-Abyssinia beyond the Red Sea; and a native prince of the ancient.Homerites was restored to the throne as the vassal or viceroy of the great Nushirvan.^1) But the nephew of Justinian declared his resolution to avenge the injuries of.his Chris- tian ally, the prince of Abyssinia, as they suggested a decent pretence to discon- tinue the annual tribute, which was poorly disguised by the name of pension. The churches of Persarmenia were oppressed by the intolerant spirit of the Magi; they secretly invoked the protection of the Christians, and after the pious murder of their satraps, the rebels were allowed and supported as the brethren and subjects of the Roman emperor. The complaints of Nushirvan were disregarded by the Byzan- tine court; Justin yielded to the importunities of the Turks, who offered an alliance against the common enemy; and the Persian monarchy was threatened at the same instant by the united forces of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"991376\">Europe</span>, of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"334481\">Ethiopia</span>, and of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"991379\">Scythia</span>. At the age of fourscore, the sovereign of the east would perhaps have chosen the peaceful enjoyment of his glory and greatness; but as soon as war became ine- vitable, he took the field with the alacrity of youth, whilst the aggressor trem- bled in the palace of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"520998\">Constantinople</span>. Nushirvan, or Chosroes, conducted in per- son the siege of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"874444\">Dara</span>; and although that important fortress had been left destitute of troops and magazines, the valour of the inhabitants resisted above five months the archers, the elephants, and the military engines of the great king. In the meanwhile his general Adarman advanced from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"893951\">Babylon</span>, traversed the desert, passed the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"912849\">Euphrates</span>, insulted the suburbs of Antioch, reduced to ashes the city, of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"658385\">Apamea</span>, and laid the spoils of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"981550\">Syria</span> at the feet of his master, whose perseve- rance, in the midst of winter, at length subverted the bulwark of the east. But these losses, which astonished the provinces and the court, produced a salutary   effect in the repentance and abdication of the emperor Justin; a new spirit arose in the Byzantine councils; and a truce of three years was obtained by the prudence of Tiberius. That seasonable interval was employed in the preparations of war; and the voice of rumour proclaimed to the world, that from the distant countries of the Alps and the Rhine, from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"991379\">Scythia</span>, Mxsia, <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1001905\">Pannonia</span>, <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"481865\">Illyricum</span>, and Isau- Tia, the strength of the imperial cavalry was re-enforced with one hundred and fifty thousand soldiers. Yet the king of Persia, without fear, or without faith, re- solved to prevent the attack of the enemy; again passed the Euphrates, and dis- missing the ambassadors of Tiberius, arrogantly commanded them to await his ar- rival at Cxsarea, the metropolis of the Cappadocian provinces. The two armies encountered each other in the battle of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"629040\">Melitene</span>; the barbarians, who darkened the air with a cloud of arrows, prolonged their line, and extended their wings across the plain; while the Romans, in deep and solid bodies, expected to prevail in closer action, by the weight of the swords and lances. A Scythian chief, who commanded their right wing, suddenly turned the flank of the enemy, attacked their rear-guard in the presence of Chosroes, penetrated to the midst of the camp, pillaged the royal tent, profaned the eternal fire, loaded a train of camels with the spoils of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599527\">Asia</span>, cut his way through the Persian host, and returned with songs of victory to his friends; who had consumed the day in single combats, or inef- fectual skirmishes. The darkness of the night, and the separation of the Romans, afforded the Persian monarch an opportunity of revenge; and one of their camps was swept away by a rapid and impetuous assault. But the review of his loss, and the consciousness of his danger, determined Chosroes to a speedy retreat; he burnt, in his passage, the vacant town of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"629040\">Melitene</span>; and, without consulting the safety of his troops, boldly swam the Euphrates on the back of an elephant. After this unsuccessful campaign, the want of magazines, and perhaps some inroad of the Turks, obliged him to disband or divide his forces; the Romans were left mas- ters of the field, and their general Justinian, advancing to the relief of the Persar- menian rebels, erected his standard on the banks of the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"884118\">Araxes</span>.

Father Pagi (Critics, tout. ii. p. 646.) has proved, that after ten years' peace, the Persian war, which continued twenty years, was re- newed A. D. 571. Mahomet was born A.
