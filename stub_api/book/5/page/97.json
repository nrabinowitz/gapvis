On the opposite bank the am- bassadors descried a thousand Armenian horse, who appeared to guard the pas- Sage of the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"912849\">Euphrates</span>. The tent of Belisarius was of the coarsest linen, the sim- ple equipage of a warrior, who disdained the luxury of the east. Around his tent, the nations who marched under his standard were arranged with skilful confusion. The Thracians and Illyrians were posted in the front, the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"98980\">Heruli</span> and Goths^in the centre; the prospect was closed by the Moors and Vandals, and their loose array seemed to multiply their numbers. Their dress was light and active: one soldier carried a whip, another a sword, a third a bow, a fourth perhaps a battle- axe, and the whole picture exhibited the intrepidity of the troops and the vigi- lance of the general. Chosroes was deluded by the address, and awed by the genius, of the lieutenant of Justinian. Conscious of the merit, and ignorant of the force, of his antagonist, he dreaded a decisive battle in a distant country, from whence not a Persian might return to relate the melancholy tale. The great king hastened to repass the Euphrates; and Belisarius pressed his retreat, by affecting to oppose a measure so salutary to the empire, and which could scarcely have been prevented by an army of a hundred thousand men. Envy might suggest to igno- rance and pride, that the public enemy had been suffered to escape: but the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"314855\">Afri</span>- can and Gothic triumphs are less glorious than this safe and bloodless victory, in which neither fortune, nor the valour of the soldiers, can subtract any part of the general's renown. The second removal of Belisarius from the Persian to the Ita- lian war, revealed the extent of his personal merit, which had corrected or sup- plied the want of discipline and courage. Fifteen generals, without concert or skill, led through the mountains of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"874350\">Armenia</span> an army of thirty thousand Romans, inattentive to their signals, their ranks, and their ensigns. Four thousand Persians, intrenched the camp of Dubis, vanquished, almost without a combat, this disor- derly multitude; their useless arms were scattered along the road, and their horses sunk under the fatigue of their rapid flight. But the Arabs of the Roman party prevailed over their brethren; the Armenians returned to their allegiance; the cities of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"874444\">Dara</span> and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"658457\">Edessa</span> resisted a sudden assault and a regular siege, and the calamities of war were suspended by those of pestilence. A tacit or formal agree- ment between the two sovereigns, protected the tranquillity of the eastern frontier; and the arms of Chosroes were confined to the Colchian or Lazic war, which has been too minutely described by the historians of the times. (1) The extreme length of the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"638838\">Euxine</span> sea,(2) from <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"520985\">Constantinople</span> to the mouth of the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"874645\">Phasis</span>, may be computed as a voyage of nine days, and a measure of seven hundred miles. From the Iberian <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"863766\">Caucasus</span> the most lofty and craggy mountains of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"599527\">Asia</span>, that river descends with such oblique vehemence, that, in a short space, it is traversed by one hundred and twenty bridges. Nor does the stream become placid and navigable, till it reaches the town of Sarapana, five days' journey from the Cyrus, which flows from the same hills, but in a contrary direction, to the Caspian lake. The proximity of these rivers has suggested the practice, or at least the idea, of wafting the precious merchandise of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"50004\">India</span> down the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"59969\">Oxus</span>, over the Caspian, up the Cyrus, and with the current of the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"874645\">Phasis</span> into the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1224\">Euxine</span> and Mediterranean seas. As it successively collects the streams of the plain of Colchos, the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"874645\">Phasis</span> moves with diminished speed, though accumulated weight. At the mouth it is sixty fathoms deep and half a league broad, but a small woody- island is interposed in the midst of the channel: the water, so soon as it has depo- sited an earthy or metallic sediment, floats on the surface of the waves, and is no longer susceptible of corruption. In a course of one hundred miles, forty of which are navigable for large vessels, the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"874645\">Phasis</span> divides the celebrated region of Colchos,(3) or Mingrelia,(4) which, on three sides, is fortified by the Iberian and (1) The Lazic war, the contest of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"423025\">Rome</span> and Persia on the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"874645\">Phasis</span>, is tediously spun through many a pace of Proccpius (Persic, lib. ii. c. 15. 17. 28   30.,) Gothic, (lib. iv. c. 7   16.,) and Agathias (lib. 2   4. p. 55   132. 111.) (2) The Periplus, or circumnavigation of the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1224\">Euxine</span> <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1224\">sea</span>, was described in Latin by Sallnst, and in Greek by Arrian. 1. The former work, which no longer exists, has been restored by the singular diligence of M. de Brasses, first president of the parliament of Dijon (Hist, de la Republique Romaine. torn. ii. lib. iii. p. 199   298.,) who ventures to assume the character of the Roman historian. His description of (lie Emineis ingeni- ously formed of alt the fragments of the original, and of all the Greeks and Latins whom Sallust might copy or by whom he might be copied; and the merit of the execution atones for (he whimsical design. 2. The Peri- plus of Arrian is addressed to the emperor Adrian (in Geograph. Minor. Hudson, torn, i.,) and contains what- ever the governor of Pontus had seen, from Trebizond to Dioscuriat; whatever he had heard from Dioscnrias*o the <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"216798\">Danube</span>; and whatever he knew from the Danube to Trebizond. (3) Besides many occasional hints from the poets, historians,&c. of antiquity, we may consult the geographi-*cal descriptions of Colchos, by Strabo (lib. xi. p. 760   765.) and Pliny (Hist. Natur. 6.5.19,&c.) (4) I shall quote, and have used, three modern descriptions of Mingrelia and the adjacent countries.. 1.
