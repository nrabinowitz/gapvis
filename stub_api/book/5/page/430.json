{"text": " II S TH E DECLIN E AN D FAL L a sinner, ignorant of the limits of his own power: the second, in the midst of four/ hundred thousand soldiers and eight thousand slaves, concealed from every human; eye the chamber where he attempted to sleep. Their sons were educated in the vices of kings; and both <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"981503\">Egypt</span> and <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"981550\">Syria</span> were recovered and possessed by the Ab- bassides during an interval of thirty years. In the decline of their empire, Me- sopotamia, with the important cities of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"874609\">Mosul</span> and Aleppo, was occupied by the Arabian princes of the tribe of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"903021\">Hamadan</span>. The poets of their court could repeat,,   without a blush, that nature had formed their countenances for beauty, their tongues for eloquence, and their hands for liberality and valour: but the genuine tale of the elevation and reign of the Hamadanites exhibits a scene of treachery, murder and parricide. At the same fatal period, the Persian kingdom was again usurped by the dynasty of the Bowides, by the sword of three brothers, who, un- der various names, were styled the support and columns of the state, and who, from the Caspian sea to the ocean, would suffer no tyrants but themselves. Under their reign, the language and genius of Persia revived, and the Arabs, three hundred and four years after the death of Mahomet, were deprived of the sceptre of the east. Radhi, the twentieth of the Abbassides, and the thirty-ninth of the successors of Mahomet, was the last who deserved the title of commander of the faithful;(t) the last (says Abulfeda) who spoke to the people, or conversed with the learned; the last who, in the expense of his household, represented the wealth and magni- ficence of the ancient caliphs. After him, the lords of the eastern world were re- duced to the most abject misery, and exposed to the blows and insults of a servile condition. The revolt of the provinces circumscribed their dominions within the walls of Bagdad; but that capital still contained an innumerable multitude, vain of their past fortune, discontented with their present state, and oppressed by the de- mands of a treasury, which had formerly been replenished by the spoil and tri- bute of nations. Their idleness was exercised by faction and controversy. Under the mask of piety, the rigid followers of Hanbal(2) invaded the pleasures of do- mestic life, burst into the houses of plebeians and princes, spilled the wine, broke the instruments, beat the musicians, and dishonoured, with infamous suspicions, the associates of every handsome youth. In each profession, which allowed room for two persons, the one was a votary, the other an antagonist, of Ali; and the Ab- bassides were awakened by the clamorous grief of the sectaries, who denied their title, and cursed their progenitors. A turbulent people could only be repressed by a military force; but who could satisfy the avarice, or assert the discipline, of the mercenaries themselves? The African and the Turkish guards drew their swords against each other, and the chief commanders, the emirs al Omra,(3) im- prisoned or deposed their sovereigns, and violated the sanctuary of the mosch and haram. If the caliphs escaped to the camp or court of any neighbouring prince, their deliverance was a change of servitude, till they were prompted by despair to invite the Bowides, the sultans of Persia, who silenced the factions of Bagdad by their irresistible arms. The civil and military powers were assumed by Moe- zaldowlat, the second of the three brothers, and a stipend of sixty thousand pounds sterling was assigned by his generosity for the private expense of the commander of the faithful. But on the fortieth day, at the audience'of the ambassadors of Chorasan, and in the presence of a trembling multitude, the caliph was dragged from his throne to a dungeon, by the command of the stranger, and the rude hands of his Dilemites. His palace was pillaged, his eyes were put out, and the mean ambition of Abbassides aspired to the vacant station of danger and disgrace. In the school of adversity, the luxurious caliphs resumed the grave and abstemi- ous virtues of the primitive times. Despoiled of their armour and silken robes, fl) Hie est ultimas chalifah qui multum atque csepius pro concione perorarit.

Abulfed. Annal. Moslem, p. 261. I have given this passage at the manner and tone of Abulfeda; but the cast of Latiu eloquence belongs moreproperly to Reiske. The Arabian historian (p. 255. 257.261   269.283, See.) bas supplied me with the most interesting facts of this paragraph. (2) Their master, on a similar occasion, showed himself of a more indulgent and tolerating spirit. Ahmed Ebn Hanbal, the head of one of the four orthodox sects, was born at Bagdad, A. H. 164, anil died there A. H. 241. He fought and suffered in the dispute concerning the creation of the Koran.
