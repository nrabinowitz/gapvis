{"text": " 106 TH E DECLIN E AN D FAL L ity, an officer of experience proposed a measure, secure by the appearance of rashness; that the Roman army should cautiously advance along the sea-shore, while the fleet preceded their march, and successively cast a bridge of boats over the mouths of the rivers, the Timavus, the Brenta, the Adige, and the Po, tha t fall into the Hadriatic to the north of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"393480\">Ravenna</span>. Nine days he reposed in the city, collected the fragments of the Italian army, and marched towards Rimini to meet the defiance of an insulting enemy. The prudence of Narses impelled him to a speedy and decisive action. His powers were the last effort of the state: the cost of each day accumulated the enor- mous account; and the nations, untrained to discipline or fatigue, might be rashly provoked to turn their arms against each other, or against their benefactor. The same.considerations might have tempered the ardour of Totila. But he was con- scious, that the clergy and people of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1052\">Italy</span> aspired to a second revolution: he felt or suspected the rapid progress oftreason, and he resolved to risk the Gothic kingdom on the chance of a day, in which the valiant would be animated by instant danger, and the disaffected might be awed by mutual ignorance. In his march from Ra- venna, the Roman general chastised the garrison of Rimini, traversed in a direct line the hills of Urbino, and re-entered the Flaminian way, nine miles beyond the perforated rock, an obstacle of ait and nature which might have stopped or retard- ed his progress. (1) The Goths were assembled in the neighbourhood of <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"423025\">Rome</span>; they advanced, without delay, to seek a superior enemy, and the two armies ap- proached each other at the distance of one hundred furlongs, between Tagina(2) and the sepulchres of the Gauls. (3) The haughty message of Narses was an of- fer, not of peace, but of pardon. The answer of the Gothic king declared his re- solution to die or conquer.\" What day,\" said the messenger,\" will you fix for the combat?\"\"The eighth day,\" replied Totila: but early the next morning he attempted to surprise a foe, suspicious of deceit, and prepared for battle. Ten thousand <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"98980\">Heruli</span> and Lombards, of approved valour and doubtful faith, were placed in the centre. Each of the wings was composed of eight thousand Romans; the right was guarded by the cavalry of the Huns, the left was covered by fifteen hun- dred chosen horse, destined, according to the emergencies of action, to sustain the retreat of their friends, or to encompass the flank of the enemy. From his prc- Ser station at the head of the right wing, the eunuch rode along the line, expressing y his voice and countenance the assurance of victory; exciting the soldiers of the emperor to punish the guilt and madness of a band of robbers; and exposing to their view gold chains, collars, and bracelets, the rewards of military virtue. From the event of a single combat, they drew an omen of success; and they beheld with pleasure the courage of fifty archers, who maintained a small eminence against three successive attacks of the Gothic cavalry. At the distance only of two bow-shots, the armies spent the morning in dreadful suspense, and the Romans tasted some necessary food, without unloosening the cuirass from their breast, or the bridle from their horses. Narses awaited the charge; and it was delayed by Totila till he had received his last succours of two thousand Goths. While he consumed the hours in fruitless treaty, the king exhibited in a narrow space the strength and agility of a warrior. His armour was enchased with gold; his purple banner float- ed with the wind; he cast his lance into the air; caught it with the right hand; shift- ed it to the left; threw himself backward; recovered his seat; and managed a fiery steed in all the paces and evolutions of the equestrian school. As soon as the suc- vered with wood*, lakes, and morassei. Man has subdued nature, and the land has been cultivated, since the waters are confined and embanked. See the learned researches of Muratori (Antiquitat. <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"1052\">Italia</span>: medii- A2vi, torn. i. dissert. 21. p. 253,254.) from Vitruvius, Strata, Herodian.old charters,and local knowledge. (1) The Flaminian way, as it is corrected from the Itineraries, and the best modern maps, by dVAnville (Analyse de I'ltalie, p. 147   162.,) may be thus stated: Rome to Narni, fifty-one Roman miles: Terni, fifty- seven, Spoleto, seventy-five; Foligno, eighty-eight; Nocera, one hundred and three; Cagli, one hundred and forty-two; <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"413180\">Intercisa</span>, one hundred and fiftv-seven; Fossombrone, one hundred and sixty; Fano, one hundred and seventy-sis.; Pesaro,one hundred and eighty-four; Rimini, two hundred and eight   about one hundred and eighty-nine English miles. He takes no notice of the death of Totila; but <span class=\"place\" data-place-id=\"109459\">Wesseling</span> (Itinerar. p. 614.) ex- changes for the field of Taginas the unknown appellation of Ptanint, eight miles from Nocera. (2) Taginss, or rather 1 adinse, is mentioned by Pliny; but the bishoprio of that obscure town, a mile from Gualdo, in the plain, was united, in the year 1007, with that of Nocera. The signs of antiquity are preserved in the local appellations, Fossato, the camp Capraia, Caprea, Bastia, Busta Gallortun.
